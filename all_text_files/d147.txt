I knew Harvey Dent.

4 64314 1593
I was his friend.

5 68110 6133
And it will be a very long time before
someone inspires us the way he did.

6 76493 2094
I believed in Harvey Dent.

7 97598 2844
Dr. Pavel, I'm CIA.

8 100601 1047
He wasn't alone.

9 101810 4050
Uh, you don't get to bring friends.
- They are not my friends.

10 106023 2002
Don't worry, no charge for them.

11 108275 3721
And why would I want them?
- They were trying to grab your prize.

12 112237 1593
They work for the mercenary.

13 114364 1502
The masked man.

14 116533 2378
Bane?
- Aye.

15 119620 2048
Get them on board. I'll call it in.

16 130255 2344
The flight plan I just filed
with the agency...

17 132758 4221
...lists me, my men, Dr. Pavel here...

18 137137 2219
...but only one of you!

19 141933 4722
First one to talk gets
to stay on my aircraft!

20 153570 3675
Who paid you to grab Dr. Pavel?

21 162037 2344
He didn't fly so good!

22 164539 2002
Who wants to try next?

23 167501 1627
Tell me about Bane!

24 169294 1502
Why does he wear the mask?

25 173590 2378
A lot of loyalty for a hired gun!

26 176134 3675
Well, perhaps he's wondering why
someone would shoot a man...

27 179971 3129
...before throwing him out of a plane.

28 187062 1718
At least you can talk.

29 188939 1126
Who are you?

30 190232 2469
It doesn't matter who we are.

31 193151 2173
What matters is our plan.

32 201660 3425
No one cared who I was
till I put on the mask.

33 206665 2002
If I pull that off, will you die?

34 208834 2173
It would be extremely painful.

35 211294 1047
You're a big guy.

36 212504 1217
For you.

37 217634 2253
Was getting caught part of your plan?

38 220178 1377
Of course.

39 226518 3504
Dr. Pavel refused our
offer in favor of yours.

40 230188 3504
We had to find out what he told you...
- Nothing. I said nothing.

41 247080 3550
Well, congratulations,
you got yourself caught!

42 250792 3425
Sir?
- Now what's the next step of your master plan?

43 255088 1718
Crashing this plane...

44 262137 1502
...with no survivors.

45 286995 1047
Mayday, Mayday!

46 334292 3174
Aah! What you doing to me? Let me out!

47 340507 1297
No!

48 342384 1718
No, no, no! No!

49 355856 2719
No! They expect one of us in
the wreckage, brother.

50 360735 1468
Have we started the fire?

51 362445 3504
Yes, the fire rises.

52 374875 3595
Calm down, doctor.
Now is not the time for fear.

53 379170 1673
That comes later.

Harvey Dent Day may not be
our oldest public holiday...

56 411411 3049
...but we're here tonight
because it's one of the most important.

57 414623 4130
Harvey Dent's uncompromising stand
against organized crime...

58 418919 4130
...had made Gotham a safer place than it was
at the time of his death, eight years ago.

59 423214 3174
This city has seen a historic turnaround.

60 426593 5302
No city is without crime, but this city is
without organized crime because the Dent Act...

61 432057 3220
...gave law enforcement teeth
in its fight against the mob.

62 435435 3675
Now people are talking about
repealing the Dent Act...

63 439272 3004
...and to them I say, 'Not on my watch.'

64 443777 2753
I want to thank the Wayne Foundation
for hosting this event.

65 446696 4130
I'm told Mr. Wayne couldn't be here tonight.
I'm sure he's with us in spirit.

66 450992 2753
And now I'm gonna give way
to an important voice...

67 453912 2469
You ever lay eyes on Wayne
at one of these things?

68 456539 1718
No one has. Not in years.

69 458416 3880
...people put their faith in
a murderous thug in a mask and a cape.

70 462462 3550
A thug who showed his true nature...

71 466174 2469
...when he betrayed the trust
of this great man...

72 469719 1593
...and murdered him in cold blood.

73 472013 2378
Sweetheart, not so fast with the chow.

74 474557 2002
Shrimp balls?
- Thank you.

75 476726 3470
Jim Gordon can tell you the truth about
Harvey Dent. I'll let him tell you himself.

76 480355 1468
Commissioner Gordon.

77 491157 1468
The truth?

78 497497 1343
I have...

79 500125 1627
...written a speech...

80 502961 2799
...telling the truth about Harvey Dent.

81 510719 2173
Maybe the time isn't right.

82 516683 2594
Maybe right now...

83 519436 2628
...all you need to know
is that there are...

84 522731 4301
...1000 inmates in Blackgate Prison
as a direct result of the Dent Act.

85 527193 4927
These are violent criminals, essential cogs
in the organized-crime machine.

86 532323 4881
Maybe, for now, all I should say
about the death of Harvey Dent is this:

87 541499 1217
It has not been for nothing.

88 544961 2753
You see the guy who owns the house?
- No. I heard...

89 547881 2970
...he never leaves the east wing.
- I heard he had an accident.

90 551009 2441
Yeah, that he's disfigured.
He has to wear a...

91 553550 1405
Mr. Till?

92 555055 3595
Why are your people
using the main staircase?

93 559225 1923
And where's Mrs. Bolton?

94 562020 2002
Uh, she's at the bar, sir.
Can I help?

95 564189 1217
The east drawing room.

96 565565 5006
Unlock the door, put the tray on the table,
lock the door again. Nothing more.

97 574616 2378
I'm sorry, Miss Tate.
I tried, but he won't see you.

98 577368 1798
And you mustn't take it personally.

99 579496 3846
Everyone knows that Wayne's holed up
in there with 8-inch nails...

100 583500 1673
...peeing into Mason jars.

101 585335 2378
It's very good of you
to let me on the grounds.

102 600058 3345
Why are you wasting your time
trying to talk to a man...

103 603561 4722
...who threw away your investment
on some save-the-world vanity project?

104 608441 2253
He can't get your money back. I can.

105 611486 4380
I could try explaining that
a save-the-world project, vain or not...

106 616032 2423
...is worth investing in, Mr. Daggett.

107 618618 3174
But you understand only money
and the power you think it buys...

108 621996 2924
...so why waste my time indeed?

109 625458 1502
Second shift reports in?

110 627127 2094
You should spend more time
with the mayor.

111 629379 1877
Well, that's your department.

112 632257 1798
Anyone shown him the crime stats?

113 634217 3300
He goes by his gut and it bothers him,
no matter what the numbers.

114 637679 3880
Must be popular with his wife.
- Not really. She took the kids to Cleveland.

115 641724 4221
He'll have plenty of time for visits.
The mayor's gonna dump him in the spring.

116 646104 1547
Really?
- Mm-hm.

117 647814 3880
But he's a hero.
- A war hero. This is peacetime.

119 681848 3379
Oh, sorry, sorry.
I'm so terribly sorry, Mr. Wayne.

120 687687 1673
It is Mr. Wayne, isn't it?

121 691107 6098
Although you don't have the long nails
or, heh, the facial scars, sir.

122 698072 2128
Is that what they say about me?

123 700575 2879
It's just that no one ever sees you.

124 703953 3880
That's a beautiful necklace. Reminds me
of one that belonged to my mother.

125 707999 3095
It can't be the same one...

126 711586 3174
...because her pearls are in this safe...

127 716049 3049
...the manufacturer clearly explained...

128 721888 1718
...is uncrackable.

129 728895 1718
Oops.

130 730772 2219
Nobody told me it was uncrackable.

131 734692 2469
I'm afraid I can't let you take those.

132 737779 3504
Look, you wouldn't beat up a woman
any more than I would beat up a cripple.

133 742825 3345
Of course, sometimes
exceptions have to be made.

134 751709 1798
Good night, Mr. Wayne.

135 768685 1377
Can I have a ride?

136 770561 1172
You read my mind.

137 772522 1547
Let's go.

138 775066 1798
Miss Tate was asking to see you again.

139 777026 1627
She's very persistent.

140 778820 2344
And quite lovely,
in case you were wondering.

141 781322 2173
I wasn't.
- What are you doing?

142 783658 3300
Examining print dust.
We've been robbed.

143 787120 2970
And this is your idea
of, uh, sounding the alarm, is it?

144 790248 2173
She took the pearls,
tracking device and all.

145 792583 1297
She?
- One of the maids.

146 794043 2628
Perhaps you should stop letting them
in this side of the house.

147 796838 2469
Perhaps you should start learning
to make your own bed.

148 800550 2844
Why were you dusting for prints?
- I wasn't.

149 804262 1468
She was.

150 809017 3049
Sir. Congressman Gilly's wife
has been calling in.

151 812228 3880
The congressman never made it home
after the Wayne Foundation event.

152 816774 1673
That's a job for the police?

153 818609 2844
When you and Dent cleaned the streets,
you cleaned them good.

154 821612 3800
Pretty soon we'll be chasing down, uh,
overdue library books.

155 827160 4176
And yet here you are,
like we're still at war.

156 833291 2253
What's your name, son?
- Blake, sir.

157 835710 1798
You have something you want to ask me?

158 839756 3345
It's about that night. This night,
eight years ago. The night Dent died.

159 843259 1968
The last confirmed sighting of the Batman.

160 845678 2799
He murders those people,
takes down two SWAT teams...

161 848639 3755
...breaks Dent's neck
and then just vanishes?

162 852852 2344
I'm not hearing a question, son.

163 855355 1968
Don't you want to know who he was?

164 858191 2423
I know exactly who he was.

165 862779 1798
He was the Batman.

166 866783 2753
Let's go see about the congressman's wife.

167 878378 1468
Master Wayne?

168 881631 1968
Master Wayne?

169 914455 2378
You haven't been down here in a long time.

170 916999 3550
Trying to find out more about
our jewel thief. I ran her prints.

171 920795 1718
Unless she's lost a lot of weight...

172 923798 2344
...she was wearing
someone else's fingerprints.

173 926300 1126
She's good.

174 927593 3550
She may be, but we have a trace
on the necklace.

175 931305 2628
We do. I cross-referenced the address
she went back to...

176 934100 3595
...with police data
on high-end B-and-E's, and, um...

177 938187 1752
Selina Kyle.

178 940106 4847
The databases are full of close-calls,
tips from fences.

179 945111 4005
She's good, but the ground
is shrinking beneath her feet.

180 949282 2753
We should send the police
before she fences the pearls.

181 952201 2219
She won't. She likes them too much.

182 954579 1798
And they weren't what she was after.

183 956539 2094
What was she after?
- My fingerprints.

184 958791 3004
It was printer toner
mixed with graphite on the safe.

185 961961 2594
It gives a good pull and it's untraceable.

186 964714 2844
Fascinating. You two should
exchange notes over coffee.

187 967717 2298
You're trying to set me
up with a jewel thief?

188 970178 4471
At this point, I'd set you up with a chimpanzee,
if it brought you back to the world.

189 974807 2253
There's nothing out there for me.

190 977310 1502
And that's the problem.

191 978978 2549
You hung up your cape and your cowl
but you didn't move on.

192 981689 2298
You never went to find a life.
To find someone.

193 984150 1377
Alfred...

194 986527 1798
...I did find someone.

195 988488 1422
I know, and you lost them.

196 990072 1968
But that's all part of living, sir.

197 992200 4130
But you're not living, you're just waiting,
hoping for things to go bad again.

198 996537 1468
Remember when you left Gotham?

199 998164 3004
Before all this, before Batman?

200 1001918 1047
You were gone seven year.

201 1003127 4597
Seven years I waited,
hoping that you wouldn't come back.

202 1007882 3630
Every year, I took a holiday.
I went to Florence.

203 1011677 2253
There's this cafe
on the banks of the Arno.

204 1014096 3254
Every fine evening I'd sit there
and order a Fernet Branca.

205 1018184 2219
I had this fantasy...

206 1021521 2674
...that I would look across the tables...

207 1024857 3470
...and I'd see you there, with a wife.

208 1028528 1798
Maybe a couple of kids.

209 1032406 3880
You wouldn't say anything to me,
nor me to you.

210 1037578 3721
But we'd both know that you'd made it.

211 1042208 1593
That you were happy.

212 1046671 3721
I never wanted you to come back to Gotham.

213 1051551 4506
I always knew there was nothing here
for you, except pain and tragedy.

214 1056222 2879
And I wanted something
more for you than that.

215 1064105 1343
I still do.

216 1069694 2844
They wash up here a couple
of times a month.

217 1072697 1468
More when it gets colder.

218 1074323 1968
Homeless, sheltering in the tunnels.

219 1077952 4130
We pulled him from the basin,
but other than that we didn't touch him.

220 1084458 1627
What?
- Name's Jimmy.

221 1086252 1422
He's from St. Swithin's.

222 1088296 3925
It's the boys' home
where I coach some ball.

223 1095011 1718
Jimmy hadn't been around for months.

224 1096887 2503
No? Why?
- Blake, you know why.

225 1099557 3846
He aged out. We don't have the resources
to keep boys on after 16.

226 1103561 2094
I thought the Wayne Foundation
gave money for that.

227 1105813 2094
Not for the past couple of years.

228 1108065 3846
He has a brother here, doesn't he?
- Mark. I'll tell him.

229 1112069 3004
I'd like to, if that's all right.

230 1116198 2094
You know what he was doing
in the tunnels?

231 1118451 3846
Lot of guys been going down the tunnels
when they age out.

232 1124582 2094
Say you can live down there.

233 1127335 1547
Say there's work down there.

234 1129045 1502
Work?

235 1130838 2674
What kind of work are you
gonna find in the sewers?

236 1133674 2628
More than you can find up here, I guess.

237 1137178 1252
So you know about him?

238 1138596 1252
Of course.

239 1141557 1798
Do you think he's coming back?

240 1145561 1297
I don't know.

243 1162411 3220
I like having someone around
to open doors for me.

244 1166916 2844
Right hand. No partials.

245 1173673 2469
Very nice.
- Mm-hm.

246 1176967 2048
Not so fast, handsome.

247 1179303 1252
You got something for me?

248 1182139 1502
Ah, yes.

249 1193192 3129
I don't know what you're planning to do
with Mr. Wayne's prints...

250 1196487 2799
...but I'm guessing you'll need his thumb.

251 1200074 2094
You don't count so good, huh?

252 1202326 1252
I count fine.

253 1203994 3174
In fact, I'm counting to 10 right now.

254 1209625 1047
Okay.

255 1214797 2674
My friend's outside. Just hit 'send.'

256 1229228 1343
This place is a little dead.

257 1230730 3254
It'll liven up in a minute. Trust me.

258 1235568 1126
Is everything okay?

259 1236861 2002
Great. Catch you later.

260 1243534 1343
Hmm.

261 1245536 2344
It would have been a lot easier...

262 1248330 1923
...to just give me what we agreed.

263 1250458 2378
We can't have loose ends.

264 1253085 3755
And even in that dress,
no one's gonna miss you.

265 1257006 1502
No.

266 1258674 1877
But my friend over there?

267 1260718 3174
Every cop in the city's missing him.

268 1264054 1343
That's cute.

269 1265556 2719
But they're not gonna be looking
in a place like this.

270 1268601 2753
I don't know.
You did just use his cell phone.

271 1299256 1673
Police! Get down now!

272 1304220 1126
Help me! Help me!

273 1305513 2048
Help me, please! Please help me!

274 1318025 2344
Keep some pressure on that, sweetheart.

275 1322947 1126
Call me?

276 1327076 2253
You okay, miss?
- He's bleeding. You gotta help him.

277 1334625 1092
I got the congressman.

278 1364655 1297
Clear!

279 1370077 3971
Manhole! Get this up!
Get the DWP down here!

280 1374999 1547
You three, down with me.

281 1376709 3425
You two, you go down,
cover the next exit!

282 1396812 1343
What, they went down there?

283 1429595 3174
We're gonna go down there, right?
FOLEY: That was a gas explosion, kid.

284 1432932 3254
Wasn't gas. It's a sewer.
- No one goes in till we know what's there.

285 1436352 1843
We know, sir. The police commissioner.

286 1438354 1843
Someone get this hothead out of here?

287 1440356 2503
And where's that DWP guy?

288 1485484 1968
Why are you here?

289 1489238 1547
Answer him.

290 1492449 1923
I was asking you.

291 1494743 1547
It's the police commissioner.

292 1500082 2469
And you brought him down here?

293 1503210 2594
We didn't know what to do.
- You panicked.

294 1506338 2970
And your weakness has cost the lives
of three others.

295 1509466 1126
No, he's alone.

296 1514471 1547
Search him.

297 1516181 1547
Then I will kill you.

298 1520000 25000
Exclusively Encoded By
-[bondfan007]-

299 1547254 2924
He's dead.
- So show me his body.

300 1550340 3425
The water runs to any one of the outflows.
We'd never find him.

301 1559808 2173
Follow him!
- Follow him?

302 1577743 1798
You okay?
You okay?

303 1579703 1923
Hey, hey, you awake?

304 1588253 1627
I need to see Bruce Wayne.

305 1590047 2469
I'm sorry, Mr. Wayne doesn't take
unscheduled calls.

306 1592674 1798
Even from a police officer.

307 1594635 3675
And if I go get a warrant for
the investigation of Harvey Dent's murder?

308 1598472 2219
That still count as unscheduled?

309 1604853 2048
What can I do for you, officer?

310 1607231 2094
Commissioner Gordon's been shot.

311 1611652 2048
He chased a gunman
down into the sewers.

312 1613862 3345
When I pulled him out, he was babbling
about an underground army.

313 1617366 1843
A masked man called Bane.

314 1620035 2344
Shouldn't you be telling
your superior officers?

315 1622538 3095
They asked me if he saw
any giant alligators.

316 1626083 1718
He needs you.

317 1629378 1297
He needs the Batman.

318 1632422 3800
If Commissioner Gordon thinks...
- Oh, he doesn't know or care who you are.

319 1637010 1968
But we've met before.

320 1640097 4130
It was a long time ago. I was a kid.
Uh, St. Swithin's.

321 1644893 3721
It used to be funded by
the Wayne Foundation. It's an orphanage.

322 1649565 4130
My mom died when I was small. It was
a car accident, I don't really remember it.

323 1654319 5177
But my dad got shot a couple years later
over a gambling debt...

324 1659741 3254
...and I remember that one just fine.

325 1664329 2924
Not a lot of people know
what it feels like, do they?

326 1667624 1752
To be angry...

327 1670127 1843
...in your bones.

328 1674506 2173
I mean, they understand.

329 1677259 1422
Foster parents.

330 1678844 2002
Everybody understands...

331 1681138 1502
...for a while.

332 1683390 3721
And then they want the angry little kid
to do something he knows he can't do.

333 1687686 1092
Move on.

334 1689354 1968
So after a while,
they stop understanding.

335 1691481 1877
They send the angry kid to a boys' home.

336 1693734 3800
I figured it out too late.
You gotta learn to hide the anger.

337 1698238 2344
Practice smiling in a mirror.

338 1702409 1502
It's like putting on a mask.

339 1705162 3550
So you showed up this one day,
in a cool car.

340 1708874 1843
Pretty girl on your arm.

341 1711793 1798
We were so excited.

342 1713879 2594
Bruce Wayne, billionaire orphan.

343 1716924 3755
I mean, we used to make up stories
about you, man. Legends.

344 1720844 3800
And, you know, with the other kids,
that's all it was, just stories, but...

345 1726266 2253
Right when I saw you,
I knew who you really were.

346 1729978 2799
I'd seen that look on your face before.

347 1733815 2128
It's the same one I taught myself.

348 1737903 2879
I don't know why you took the fall
for Dent's murder...

349 1741657 2048
...but I'm still a
believer in the Batman...

350 1744534 1673
...even if you're not.

351 1748914 4927
Why did you say that your boys' home used
to be funded by the Wayne Foundation?

352 1754002 1752
Because the money stopped.

353 1755921 4221
Might be time to get some fresh air.
Start paying attention to the details.

354 1761009 2378
Some of those details
might need your help.

355 1765180 1343
You check that name?
Bane?

356 1766682 2674
He's a mercenary.
No other known names.

357 1769518 2469
Him and his men were behind
a coup in West Africa...

358 1772145 4506
...that secured mining operations
for our friend John Daggett.

359 1777359 2799
Now Daggett's brought them here.
- Or so it seems.

360 1782239 2128
I'll keep digging.
- Yeah.

361 1785575 6224
Alfred, why did the Wayne Foundation
stop funding boys' homes in the city?

362 1791957 5097
The foundation is funded by
the profits of Wayne Enterprises.

363 1797379 1547
There have to be some.

364 1799089 3345
Time to talk to Mr. Fox, I think.
- I'll get him on the phone.

365 1802592 4005
No, no, no. Do we still have
any cars around the place?

366 1806763 1877
Yes. One or two.

367 1808807 2002
I need an appointment at the hospital
for my leg.

368 1810976 2753
Which hospital?
- Whichever one Jim Gordon's in.

369 1818108 2799
I have seen worse cartilage in knees.
- That's good.

370 1821069 2503
No. That's because there is
no cartilage in your knee.

371 1823739 3345
And not much of any use
in your elbows or your shoulders.

372 1827242 2378
Between that and the scar tissue
on your kidneys...

373 1829786 2674
...the residual concussive damage
to your brain tissue...

374 1832622 2674
...and the general scarred-over quality
of your body...

375 1835459 2924
...I cannot recommend that you go heli-skiing.
- Right.

376 1840000 15000
Exclusively Encoded By
-[bondfan007]-

377 1853852 2503
We were in this together...

378 1858482 1547
...then you were gone.

379 1860192 2128
The Batman wasn't needed any more.

380 1862486 3129
We won.
- Based on a lie.

381 1867074 6053
And now there's evil rising
from where we tried to bury it.

382 1873330 4471
The Batman has to come back.

383 1877959 2469
What if he doesn't exist any more?

384 1880587 3470
He must.

385 1897771 1843
You took my goddamn wallet, didn't you?

386 1899773 2879
You f... You took my wallet!
- No, I...

387 1903360 2219
Get out.
- She took my... Ah!

388 1905737 2594
Now.
- Creep!

389 1908490 2924
I don't know what he's so upset about.
There's only 60 bucks in here.

390 1911576 1752
Probably the watch.

391 1928593 1047
Who's that?

392 1929803 2128
A stiff can barely climb
out of his sports car.

393 1932097 2128
No, that's Bruce Wayne!
- Mr. Wayne, over here!

394 1939271 2378
I'm not sure if my assistant...
- Right through here.

395 1941815 1502
Thank you so much.

396 1948572 3800
Bruce Wayne at a charity ball.

397 1953410 1877
Miss Tate, isn't it?

398 1956288 3049
Even before you became a recluse,
you never came to these things.

399 1959791 3379
The proceeds go to the big fat spread.
It's not about charity.

400 1963336 4346
It's about feeding the ego
of whichever society hag laid this on.

401 1968175 2423
Actually, this is my party, Mr. Wayne.

402 1970886 1547
Oh.

403 1972804 5131
And the proceeds will go where they should,
because I paid for the big fat spread myself.

404 1978351 1377
That's very generous of you.

405 1979978 3846
You have to invest if you want to restore
balance to the world.

406 1983982 1752
Take our clean-energy project.

407 1986276 2628
Sometimes the investment
doesn't pay off.

408 1989696 3675
I'm sorry.
- You have a practiced apathy, Mr. Wayne.

409 1993533 5131
But a man who doesn't care about the world
doesn't spend half his fortune to save it.

410 1999664 3004
And isn't so wounded when it fails...

411 2003084 1627
...that he goes into hiding.

412 2006171 2094
Have a good evening, Mr. Wayne.

413 2012302 1673
WAYNE:
Mind if I cut in?

414 2015055 1843
Thank you.

415 2019768 3174
You don't seem happy to see me.
- You were supposed to be a shut-in.

416 2023104 1877
I felt like some fresh air.

417 2025774 2128
Why didn't you call the police?

418 2028235 2674
I have a powerful friend
who deals with things like this.

419 2031071 4301
That's a brazen costume for a cat burglar.

420 2035909 2594
Yeah? Who are you pretending to be?

421 2038662 2719
Bruce Wayne, eccentric billionaire.

422 2042457 2002
Who's your date?
SELINA: His wife's in Ibiza.

423 2044626 3800
She left her diamonds behind, though.
Worried they might get stolen.

424 2048588 2048
It's pronounced 'Ibiza.'

425 2051216 3675
You wouldn't want these folks realizing
you're a crook, not a social climber.

426 2055053 3129
You think I care what anyone
in this room thinks of me?

427 2059849 2344
I doubt you care what anyone
in any room thinks of you.

428 2062352 3721
Don't condescend, Mr. Wayne.
You don't know a thing about me.

429 2066690 4221
Well, Selina Kyle, I know you came here
from your walk-up in Old Town.

430 2071069 1843
A modest place for a master jewel thief.

431 2073071 3300
Which means that either
you're saving for retirement...

432 2076992 2094
...or you're in deep with the wrong people.

433 2080412 3971
You don't get to judge me because you were
born in the master bedroom of Wayne Manor.

434 2084541 4346
Actually, I was born in the Regency Room.
- I started out doing what I had to.

435 2090046 3379
Once you've done what you had to,
they never let you do what you want to.

436 2093592 1252
Start fresh.

437 2095010 3220
Ugh. There's no fresh
start in today's world.

438 2098388 3049
Any 12-year-old with a cell phone
could find out what you did.

439 2101600 3800
Everything we do is collated
and quantified. Everything sticks.

440 2105979 2002
Is that how you justify stealing?

441 2108148 2594
I take what I need from those
who have more than enough.

442 2110900 2298
I don't stand on the shoulders
of people with less.

443 2113361 1047
Robin Hood?

444 2114571 4130
I think I'd do more to help someone than
most of the people in this room. Than you.

445 2119659 2094
You think maybe you're assuming
a little too much?

446 2121911 4050
Maybe you're being unrealistic about what's
really in your pants other than your wallet.

447 2126124 1047
Ouch.

448 2127667 5097
You think all this can last?
There's a storm coming, Mr. Wayne.

449 2133381 4221
You and your friends better batten down
the hatches, because when it hits...

450 2137761 3880
...you're all gonna wonder how you
ever thought you could live so large...

451 2141806 3095
...and leave so little for the rest of us.

452 2148188 2503
You sound like
you're looking forward to it.

453 2152108 1593
I'm adaptable.

454 2153860 3254
Those pearls do look better on you
than they did in my safe.

455 2157864 2219
But I still can't let you keep them.

456 2167749 2173
You... You scared her off!

457 2172837 1547
Not likely.

458 2176508 1377
Must have lost my ticket.

459 2178051 2753
Your wife said you were taking a cab home.
- My wife?

460 2188853 1422
Just you, sir?

461 2193358 2002
Don't worry, Master Wayne.

462 2196111 3049
Takes a little time to get back
in the swing of things.

463 2201324 3254
Bruce Wayne, as I live and breathe.

464 2206371 2378
What brings you out of cryo-sleep,
Mr. Wayne?

465 2208915 1752
You haven't lost your sense of humor.

466 2210834 2503
Even if you have lost most of my money.

467 2213503 1502
Actually, you did that.

468 2215171 2719
If you funnel your entire R and D budget...

469 2218049 2924
...into a fusion project
that you then mothball...

470 2221136 2344
...your company is unlikely to thrive.

471 2223638 1047
What are my options?

472 2224848 2378
Well, if you're unwilling
to turn on the machine...

473 2228101 1843
I can't. I can't, Lucius.

474 2230520 1547
Well, then sit tight.

475 2232230 1718
Your majority keeps Daggett at bay...

476 2234107 4005
...while we figure out a future for
the energy program with Miranda Tate.

477 2238278 2628
She has supported the project
all the way.

478 2241322 3174
She's smart. And quite lovely.

479 2245493 3049
We all just want what's
best for you, Bruce.

480 2249289 1752
Show her the machine.

481 2251958 1297
I'll think it over.

482 2253418 1343
Anything else?

483 2254919 2253
Nope. Why?

484 2257338 4050
These conversations used to end
with an unusual request.

485 2262135 1422
I retired.

486 2263845 4096
Mm-hm. Well, let me show you
some stuff anyway.

487 2272061 1502
Just for old times' sake.

488 2278026 2048
I figured you'd have shut
this place down.

489 2280236 2674
Oh, it was always shut down, officially.

490 2283072 1092
All this new stuff.

491 2284324 4631
After your father died, Wayne Enterprises
set up 14 different defense subsidiaries.

492 2289120 2674
For years, I've been shuttering
and consolidating...

493 2291956 2378
...all the different prototypes
under one roof.

494 2294501 1718
My roof.
- Why?

495 2296503 2674
Keep them from falling
into the wrong hands.

496 2302008 2423
Oh, now you're just showing off.

497 2305595 4631
Defense Department projects
for tight geometry urban pacification.

498 2310725 4597
Rotors are configured to maneuver
between buildings without recirculation.

499 2315772 1502
What's it called?

500 2317899 4221
Oh, it has a long, uninteresting
Wayne Enterprises designation.

501 2322278 3379
I just took to calling it the Bat.

502 2326574 2628
And, yes, Mr. Wayne, it does come in black.

503 2330995 2970
Works fine, except for the autopilot.

504 2334415 1923
Takes a better mind than mine to fix it.

505 2336501 1377
Better mind?

506 2338628 2799
Well, I was trying to be modest.

507 2341798 1923
A less busy mind.

508 2344133 1297
Yours.

509 2352976 3470
Is it really painful?
- You're very welcome to try it, Alfred.

510 2356604 1718
Happy watching. Thank you, sir.

511 2361442 1422
Not bad.

512 2367907 1422
Not bad at all.

513 2372787 3129
If you're seriously considering
going back out there...

514 2376082 2128
...you should hear the rumors
surrounding Bane.

515 2378376 1047
I'm all ears.

516 2380753 3675
There is a prison
in a more ancient part of the world.

517 2384924 4881
A pit where men are thrown
to suffer and die.

518 2390013 3721
But sometimes
a man rises from the darkness.

519 2393975 4130
Sometimes the pit sends something back.

520 2398271 2128
Bane.
- Bane.

521 2400690 3049
Born and raised in hell on earth.

522 2403902 3925
Born in a prison?
- No one knows why, or how he escaped.

523 2407989 2594
But they do know that once he did...

524 2410742 4176
...he was trained by Ra's Al Ghul,
your mentor.

525 2415079 2002
Bane was a member
of the League of Shadows?

526 2417248 2173
And then he was excommunicated.

527 2419876 5723
And any man who is too extreme
for Ra's Al Ghul is not to be trifled with.

528 2425757 3254
I didn't realize I was known
for trifling with criminals.

529 2429636 1297
That was then.

530 2431387 2799
And you can strap up your leg
and put your mask back on...

531 2434349 2594
...but that doesn't make you
what you were.

532 2437101 4631
If this man is everything that you
say he is, then the city needs me.

533 2441898 2970
The city needs Bruce Wayne.

534 2445234 1923
Your resources. Your knowledge.

535 2447320 3095
It doesn't need your body, or your life.

536 2451199 1172
That time's past.

537 2452533 3379
You're afraid that if I go back out there,
I'll fail.

538 2456079 1252
No.

539 2458957 2844
I'm afraid that you want to.

You can't short the stock because
Bruce Wayne goes to a party.

542 2479686 3800
Wayne coming back is change.
Change is either good or bad. I vote bad.

543 2483648 1297
On what basis?

544 2485108 1547
I flipped a coin.

545 2492782 1923
It says rye... I said no rye, man.

546 2497286 2799
Hey, rookie, lose the helmet.
We need faces for camera.

547 2506129 1923
Come on. Let's go scalping.

548 2523479 1047
Come on.

549 2549589 1877
Everybody down, now!

550 2569776 2719
This is a stock exchange.
There's no money you can steal.

551 2572653 3379
Really?
Then why are you people here?

552 2592507 2753
Everybody, stay back!
Go down to the end of the block!

553 2595426 1968
We have an emergency situation!

554 2600681 1593
You gotta get in there!

555 2602433 1593
This is a hostage situation.

556 2604185 3425
No, this is a robbery. They have
direct access to the online trading desk.

557 2607772 1798
I'm not risking my men for your money.

558 2613820 2344
We have to ask you to move.
We have a situation.

559 2616322 2048
It's not our money, it's everybody's.

560 2618533 2094
Really?
Mine's in my mattress.

561 2620785 4506
You don't put these guys down, that stuffing in
your mattress might be worth a whole lot less.

562 2625456 2253
Cut the fiber cable
and take out that cell tower.

563 2627875 2503
Thank you.
- That'll slow them down.

564 2631045 1047
Move back!

565 2632255 2674
All the way! Go! Sir, get back, please!

566 2636425 1593
They cut the fiber.

567 2639178 1092
Cell's working.

568 2640429 1343
For now.

569 2647436 3675
Get all these barriers up. All of them up. No
one gets in or out of any of these streets.

570 2651274 1627
Where am I supposed to move it?

571 2653067 1297
Back it up.

572 2658948 2219
All right, just stay in your vehicle, okay?

573 2667707 2423
How much longer does
the program need?

574 2671711 1172
Eight minutes.

575 2674463 1252
Time to go mobile.

576 2675882 1343
Everybody, up!

577 2681470 1377
You two, move!

578 2685683 1297
Thank you.

579 2687935 1468
Steady.

580 2698112 1377
Steady.

581 2707413 1047
I've got something.

582 2709582 2503
Hold your fire, they've got hostages.

583 2712251 1252

Shoot the tires.

589 2743908 1468
There's no shot.

590 2746786 3129
Now back off.
Back off, they've got hostages.

591 2750081 2753
...P.D. are pursuing
the four suspects through downtown...

592 2753000 2048
...in response to a hostage situation.

593 2761550 1673
What's going on with the lights?

594 2770142 1468
It can't be.

595 2772061 1092
What the hell was that?

596 2773312 2844
Oh, boy, you are in
for a show tonight, son.

597 2781654 2002
Please! Help, help, help!

598 2801507 1047
Sorry.

599 2803175 3300
Put that thing away
before you hurt yourself. Get in!

600 2806637 3129
Let's go. You, get in the car.
They've spotted the Batman.

601 2821068 3129
Call everyone in.
Every car patrol, beat cop, off-duty too.

602 2824363 2719
Pull them in now. I'm gonna do
what Jim Gordon never could.

603 2827241 3220
What's that?
- I'm gonna take down the Batman.

604 2830619 3049
...are confirming
four suspects are carrying two hostages...

605 2833831 2048
...kidnapped from
the Gotham Stock Exchange.

606 2836042 3300
Reports from the eyewitnesses...
- Scott, dead center of your screen.

607 2839503 2423
What do you see?
- I see Batman.

608 2842089 2674
Hard to believe, but the suspects
are now being pursued...

609 2844925 1968
...by what appears to be the Batman.

610 2847053 1092
Well, what do you know?

611 2853309 1968
Sir, what about the armed robbers?

612 2857688 2970
Please! Just let me go! Please!

613 2870326 3470
One bike's pulled off.
No hostage. Should we pursue?

614 2878334 1547
Negative. Stay on the Batman.

615 2882797 1798
He's getting away.
- Who do you wanna catch?

616 2884757 2549
Some robber, or the son of a bitch
who killed Harvey Dent?

617 2891514 2503
...The entire upper west hill...

618 2894183 2048
Central Heights
and East Park Side areas.

619 2896644 2674
Eight years, and he has to pick tonight.

620 2899647 2094
He's drawing the cops off Bane.

621 2910574 1968
Please! Just let me go!

622 2913035 1047
Please!

623 2992364 1377
We lost him.

624 2993991 1673
How could you lose him?

625 2995826 1593
He's got a lot of firepower.

626 2997578 1092
What, and you don't?

627 3003459 1752
He's heading back downtown.

628 3005377 2048
Then he's as dumb as he dresses.

634 3072152 3425
Bane says the Batman interfered,
but the task was accomplished.

635 3075739 1627
What about the men they arrested?

636 3077533 4096
He said, and I quote,
'They would die before talking.'

637 3082830 2298
Where does he find these guys?

638 3086709 1752
Open the champagne.

639 3090504 2503
And can we get some girls in here?

640 3093173 1422
Careful what you wish for.

641 3105603 1343
Cat got your tongue?

642 3107104 1217
You dumb bitch.

Nobody ever accused me

You're dumb for coming here tonight.

645 3115070 1673
I want what you owe me.

Want doesn't get.

647 3120993 4050
Nice outfit.
Those heels make it tough to walk?

648 3125205 1217
I don't know.
- Aah!

649 3127041 1377
Do they?

650 3129752 1593
So where is it?
- Where's what?

651 3131545 2344
The program. The 'clean slate.'

652 3134131 3220
The ultimate tool for a master thief
with a record.

653 3138093 1547
Hold it right there!

654 3153150 1047
Where is it?

655 3154735 1593
The clean slate?

656 3156487 2628
Where you type in someone's name,
date of birth...

657 3159281 4176
...in a few minutes they're gone
from every database on earth?

658 3163994 2799
Sound a little too good to be true?
- You're lying!

659 3166955 2594
Rykin Data took it to prototype stage.

660 3169708 1968
That's why I bought them.

661 3172586 1877
But they had nothing.

662 3174880 1718
It was a gangland myth.

663 3187935 1172
Stay back!

664 3192481 1627
I'm not bluffing!

665 3195025 1377
They know.

666 3196819 1422
They just don't care.

667 3215587 1297
You've gotta be kidding me.

668 3217047 2549
No guns. No killing.
- Where's the fun in that?

669 3238736 2799
My mother warned me about
getting into cars with strange men.

670 3241697 1047
This isn't a car.

671 3292873 1593
See you around.

672 3295459 1126
You're welcome.

673 3296960 1377
I had it under control.

674 3298504 1343
Those weren't street thugs.

675 3300005 2094
They were trained killers.

676 3302257 1673
I saved your life.

677 3304134 4756
In return, I need to know what you did
with Bruce Wayne's fingerprints.

678 3309056 2549
Wayne wasn't kidding about
a powerful friend.

679 3312768 1877
I sold his prints to Daggett...

680 3316605 2469
...for something that doesn't even exist.

681 3319358 3721
I doubt many people get the better of you.
- Hey, when a girl's desperate...

682 3323237 2344
What's he gonna do with them?
- I don't know...

683 3325739 3379
...but Daggett seemed pretty interested
in that mess at the stock market.

684 3334373 1468

I retrieved this.

689 3367114 2469
Aren't the police supposed
to be investigating, then?

690 3369741 3425
They don't have the tools to analyze it.
- They would if you gave them to them.

691 3373328 2503
One man's tool is another man's weapon.

692 3375998 3345
In your mind, perhaps. But there aren't
many things you can't turn into a weapon.

693 3379501 2128
Alfred, enough.
The police weren't getting it done.

694 3381795 3379
Perhaps they might have if you
hadn't made a sideshow of yourself.

695 3385340 3800
You thought I didn't have it in me.
- You led a bloated police force on a chase...

696 3389303 2594
...with a load of fancy new toys from Fox.

697 3392055 2844
What about when you come up
against him? What then?

698 3395058 4801
I'll fight harder. I always have.
- Look. His speed, his ferocity, his training.

699 3400022 2674
I see the power of belief.

700 3402858 2924
I see the League of Shadows resurgent.

701 3405944 1468
You said he was excommunicated.

702 3407571 1877
By Ra's Al Ghul.

703 3410490 1092
Who leads them now?

704 3411742 2594
Ra's Al Ghul was the League of Shadows
and I beat him.

705 3414494 2753
Bane is a mercenary.
We need to find out what he's up to.

706 3418457 2549
Trades of some kind. Coded.

707 3421835 2799
And my fingerprint,
courtesy of Selina Kyle.

708 3424796 1092
Get this to Fox.

709 3426048 4346
He can crack the code and tell us
what trades they were executing.

710 3434056 3675
I'll get this to Mr. Fox, but no more.

711 3439394 3550
I've sewn you up, I've set your bones,
but I won't bury you.

712 3443357 3129
I've buried enough members
of the Wayne family.

713 3447277 5348
You'll leave me?
- You see only one end to your journey.

714 3453075 4597
Leaving is all I have
to make you understand.

715 3457955 3504
You're not Batman any more.
You have to find another way.

716 3461625 3971
You used to talk about finishing,
about a life beyond that awful cave.

717 3465754 3721
Alfred, Rachel died knowing that
we had decided to be together.

718 3469633 3880
That was my life beyond the cave.
I can't just move on.

719 3473971 2844
She... She didn't. She couldn't.

720 3477641 1377
What if she had?

721 3479184 1468
She... I can't change that.

722 3480811 3004
What if before she died
she wrote a letter...

723 3483981 3470
...saying she chose
Harvey Dent over you?

724 3491822 1343
And what if...

725 3494241 1843
...to spare you pain...

726 3497911 1877
...I burnt that letter?

727 3500622 4221
How dare you use Rachel to try to stop me?

728 3505043 3425
I am using the truth, Master Wayne.

729 3509131 4881
Maybe it's time we all stopped trying to
outsmart the truth and let it have its day.

730 3515637 2128
I'm sorry.
- You're sorry?

731 3517931 2719
You expect to destroy my world...

732 3523020 2378
...and then think that
we're gonna shake hands?

733 3525564 1673
No, no, no.

734 3528483 2094
I know what this means.

735 3530736 1092
What does it mean?

736 3531987 2423
It means your hatred.

737 3534614 3721
And it also means losing someone
that I have cared for...

738 3538493 4426
...since I first heard his cries echo...

739 3543582 2094
...through this house.

740 3546001 4255
But it might also mean saving your life.

741 3551548 2423
And that is more important.

Long-term, we may be able to prove fraud.
But for now, you're completely broke...

751 3605936 3425

into the hands of John Daggett.

752 3609523 3846
The weapons. We can't let Daggett
get his hands on Applied Sciences.

753 3613527 2970
Applied Sciences is all looked up

Miranda Tate.

756 3622536 3300
Let's convince the board to get behind her.
Let's show her the reactor.

757 3625997 3504
We're meeting her there in 35 minutes,
so you better get dressed.

758 3629835 3550
You brought me out here
to show me this, Mr. Fox?

759 3633588 1968
Bear with me, Miss Tate.

760 3639261 3470
Please keep hands and feet inside
the car at all times.

761 3648311 1798
This is it, isn't it?

762 3650689 2594
The reactor is beneath the river...

763 3653817 3755
...so it can be instantly flooded
in the event of a security breach.

764 3658280 2924
Is Bruce Wayne really that paranoid?

765 3661366 2298
I'm gonna plead the fifth on that one.

766 3670542 2924
I thought you might like to see
what your investment built.

767 3673628 1673
No fossil fuels.

768 3675463 2594
Free clean energy for an entire city.

Three years ago, a Russian
scientist published a paper...

770 3681928 2298

771 3684389 4927
One week later, your reactor
started developing problems.

772 3690562 1627
I think this machine works.

773 3692355 6633
Miranda, if it were operational,
the danger to Gotham would be too great.

774 3699154 3095
Would it make you feel better to know
that the Russian scientist...

...died in a plane crash six months ago?

776 3705368 3504
Someone will work out what Dr. Pavel did.

777 3709039 6178
Someone will figure out a way to make
this power source into a nuclear weapon.

778 3716546 4380
I need you to take control
of Wayne Enterprises...

779 3721384 1252
...and this reactor.

780 3723053 1126
To do what with it?

781 3724346 1502
Nothing.

782 3726431 2128
Until we can guarantee its safety.

783 3728725 1217
And if we can't?

784 3730227 1547
Decommission it. Flood it.

785 3731937 3800
Destroy the world's best chance
for a sustainable future?

786 3735899 1627
If the world's not ready, yes.

787 3737692 4301
Bruce, if you want to save the world,
you have to start trusting it.

788 3742364 1377
I'm trusting you.

789 3743907 1968
Doesn't count. You have no choice.

790 3746618 2344
I could have flooded this chamber
at any time.

791 3749120 2048
I'm choosing to trust you.

792 3752040 1217
Please.

793 3760507 4096
All right, ladies and gentlemen.
This meeting will now come to order.

794 3764761 3174
I'd like to point out that we have
a non-board member here...

795 3768098 3345
...which is highly irregular,
even if his family name is above the door.

796 3771601 2253
Bruce Wayne's family built this company.

797 3774020 1752
And he himself has run it.

798 3775939 4756
Into the ground, sir! Does anybody disagree?
Check the share price this morning.

799 3780860 4255
Crazy gambling on futures has not
only cost Mr. Wayne his seat...

800 3785282 2298
...it's cost us all a lot of money.

801 3787742 1843
And he has to go.

802 3790453 2002
I'm afraid he has a point, Mr. Wayne.

803 3800880 1673
Now, back to business.

804 3803258 3220
Mr. Wayne, over here!
- How's it feel to be one of the people?

805 3806636 4050
Mr. Wayne, they're towing your car! I
didn't know what to do, they had paperwork.

806 3812434 1718
Looks like you need a ride, huh?

807 3814311 2219
Wayne, we'll give you a ride!

808 3816688 4301
How the hell did Miranda Tate get
the inside track on the Wayne board?

809 3821151 2173
She been meeting with him?
Sleeping with him?

810 3823486 2970
Not that we know of.
- You don't know much of anything, do you?

811 3826614 1923
Where's Bane?
- We told him it was urgent.

812 3828700 2628
Where is that masked...?
- Speak of the devil...

813 3831494 2253
...and he shall appear.

814 3833913 2469
What the hell is going on?

815 3837000 3379
The plan is proceeding as expected.
- Oh, really?

816 3840545 2799
Do I look like I'm running
Wayne Enterprises right now?

817 3843631 4551
Your hit on the stock exchange,
it didn't work, my friend.

818 3848345 5131
And now you have my construction crews
going around the city at 24 hours a day.

819 3853641 4927
How exactly is that supposed to help
my company absorb Wayne's?

820 3861149 2378
Leave us.
- No. You stay here.

821 3863693 1593
I'm in charge.

822 3866071 2378
Do you feel in charge?

823 3873495 1752
I've paid you a small fortune.

824 3875413 2970
And this gives you power over me?

825 3878958 1422
What is this?

826 3880543 4972
Your money and infrastructure
have been important...

827 3885882 1126
...till now.

828 3887509 1126
What are you?

829 3888802 1843
I'm Gotham's reckoning.

830 3890804 2879
Here to end the borrowed time
you've all been living on.

831 3895725 3129
You're pure evil.

832 3899020 2298
I'm necessary evil.

833 3901481 1923
No. No, no, no!

834 3907987 2469
When you started, why the mask?

835 3910615 2674
To protect the people closest to me.
- But you were a loner, right?

836 3913451 3129
You didn't have any family?
- There are always people you care about.

837 3916746 3925
You just don't realize how much
until they're gone.

838 3921084 2879
The idea was to be a symbol.

839 3924129 3129
Batman could be anybody.

840 3927799 1547
That was the point.

841 3929717 3220
Well, it was damn good to see him back.
- Not everybody agrees.

842 3933138 4221
They'll figure that out in the end.
- You got anything on Bane's whereabouts?

843 3937892 3220
Yeah. I got 500 pages of tunnel records
and a flashlight.

844 3941271 2094
I could use some help, actually.

845 3944357 1877
You know what? Drop me in Old Town.

846 3949863 1593
Hey, hey, hey. I don't think so!

847 3951614 2173
That's the way this works!
- I don't think so!

848 3953950 2253
That is the way...
- He's not a mark.

849 3956369 2674
And he doesn't have a cent
to his name, anyway.

850 3959539 4301
Yeah, it's not much.
But it's more than you've got right now.

851 3964002 2423
Actually, they're letting
me keep the house.

852 3966588 2594
The rich don't even go broke
the same as the rest of us, huh?

853 3969340 3971
My powerful friend might hope
to change your mind about leaving.

854 3973470 2628
And how would he do that?
- By giving you what you want.

855 3976264 2674
It doesn't exist.
- He says it does.

856 3979642 1718
He wants to meet tonight.

857 3981519 1047
Why?

858 3982729 2924
He needs to find Bane.
Says you'd know how.

859 3988985 2219
Tell him I'll think about it.
- Okay.

860 3991362 1877
I like your place.

861 3994699 1126
Mr. Wayne?

862 3998453 2253
I'm sorry they took all your money.

863 4001789 1297
No, you're not.

864 4004209 2799
Can we help you, officer?
- Uh, yeah.

865 4007170 3550
John Daggett's body was just found
in a Dumpster about an hour ago.

866 4010882 1968
Thought you might want to know.
- Why?

867 4013009 4130
His name's all over these permits I just
pulled to, uh, map the tunnels under Gotham.

868 4017305 3880
That's MTA maintenance, uh,
sewer construction, couple of other things.

869 4021351 3004
Where did you get to
with the tunnel searches?

870 4024521 2879
Remind me to tell detail
to keep hotheads out.

871 4027565 2173
We've had teams down there.
It's a huge network.

872 4029901 3345
Well, get more men. Work a grid.
I want him found.

873 4033404 2344
Yeah, the, uh, masked man. We're on it.

874 4035907 2753
Lose the uniform,
you're working for me now.

875 4038826 2423
We could use some hotter heads
around here.

876 4041412 4130
Sir, that could also be a coincidence.
- You're a detective now, son.

877 4045708 3129
You're not allowed to believe
in coincidence any more.

880 4061933 1172
No.

881 4063268 1673
I'm on my own now.

882 4065770 1422
Do you have keys?

883 4068398 1172
Never needed them.

884 4076239 1752
Hope you didn't like me for my money.

885 4078741 2594
Suffering builds character.

886 4087375 2549
I'll take care of your
parents' legacy, Bruce.

887 4092088 1343
Who's this?

888 4101264 1343
Where's Alfred?

889 4104392 1377
He left...

890 4107437 1968
...taking everything.

What's that?

My power's been shut off.

894 4143348 1468
You're good at that.

895 4145933 2924
When I was a child,
we had almost nothing.

896 4149312 4506
But on the nights when we had a fire,
we felt very rich indeed.

897 4155652 2970
I assumed your family was wealthy.

898 4159405 1502
Not always.

899 4161908 1547
Not when I was young.

900 4164118 1843
An old mistake.

901 4167080 1877
I've made a few myself.

902 4170208 1627
More than a few.

903 4174087 1502
We could leave.

904 4176089 1047
Tonight.

905 4178007 4050
Take my plane, go anywhere we wanted.

906 4183846 1798
Someday, perhaps.

907 4186599 1468
Not tonight.

908 4216254 1843
Don't be shy.

909 4220258 2423
Wayne says you can get me
the clean slate.

910 4223010 2753
That depends.
- On what?

911 4225930 1627
On what you want it for.

912 4227724 2924
I acquired it to keep it out
of the wrong hands.

913 4231436 1752
Still don't trust me, huh?

914 4234313 2048
How can we change that?

915 4236524 1798
Start by taking me to Bane.

916 4241362 1593
You asked.

917 4245241 2048
From here,
Bane's men patrol the tunnels.

918 4247618 2469
And they're not your average brawlers.

919 4250580 1502
Neither am I.

920 4259881 1092
He's behind you.
- Who?

921 4261132 1047
Me.

922 4267346 1968
What do you think you're...?

923 4281444 2219
Just a little further.

924 4290870 2549
I had to find a way to stop them
trying to kill me.

925 4293581 2423
You made a serious mistake.

926 4296584 4927
Not as serious as yours, I fear.

927 4305176 1047
Bane.

928 4306385 3095
Let's not stand on ceremony here...

929 4310723 2344
...Mr. Wayne.

930 4324278 2173
Peace has cost you your strength.

931 4326614 1843
Victory has defeated you.

932 4390219 5632
Theatricality and deception, powerful
agents to the uninitiated.

933 4396017 2799
But we are initiated, aren't we, Bruce?

934 4399729 2844
Members of the League of Shadows.

935 4404567 2378
And you betrayed us.

936 4407778 2924
'Us'?
You were excommunicated...

937 4410865 2549
...by a gang of psychopaths.

938 4417872 2924
I am the League of Shadows.

939 4420958 3129
And I'm here to fulfill
Ra's Al Ghul's destiny.

940 4437642 2094
You fight like a younger man.

941 4439894 2298
Nothing held back.

942 4442355 3220
Admirable, but mistaken.

943 4448986 4597
Oh, you think darkness is your ally?

944 4453741 2719
But you merely adopted the dark.

945 4457119 2048
I was born in it.

946 4459747 2128
Molded by it.

947 4463042 3095
I didn't see the light
until I was already a man.

948 4466295 3254
By then, it was nothing to me
but blinding!

949 4472551 3971
The shadows betray you
because they belong to me!

950 4481894 3220
I will show you where
I have made my home...

951 4485272 3345
...whilst preparing to bring justice.

952 4490820 2219
Then I will break you.

953 4501789 1877
Your precious armory.

954 4504333 3345
Gratefully accepted. We will need it.

955 4516387 3800
Ah, yes. I was wondering
what would break first.

956 4524937 1798
Your spirit...

957 4531152 1718
...or your body.

Get me Commissioner Gordon. I got a line

960 4593089 1172
Excuse me, miss.
- Uh, yes?

961 4594423 3174
I'm gonna need to see your ticket
and identification, please.

962 4597760 2048
Oh. Do you mind?

963 4612608 3129
I showed your picture to
the congressman. Guess what.

964 4616028 2549
Don't tell me. Still in love?

965 4618739 2549
Oh, head over heels.
Pressing charges, though.

966 4622326 2879
You've made some mistakes, Ms. Kyle.

967 4626163 3174
Girl's gotta eat.
- And you have an appetite.

968 4629667 2253
Why would you run?
You can't hide with a record like this.

969 4632086 2048
Maybe it's not you I'm running from.

970 4634296 1877
Who then? Bane?

971 4636340 1468
What do you know about him?

972 4638843 3470
That you should be as afraid of him
as I am.

973 4642471 1877
We can offer you protection.

974 4647643 1047
Okay.

975 4653357 3504
When I spotted you, I was looking
for a friend of mine. Bruce Wayne.

976 4659738 1502
Did they kill him?

977 4662992 1627
I'm not sure.

978 4684430 1627
Why didn't you just...

979 4688058 1172
...kill me?

980 4689393 3470
You don't fear death, you welcome it.

981 4693397 2753
Your punishment must be more severe.

982 4696901 1593
Torture?

983 4698819 1092
Yes.

984 4700863 1877
But not of your body.

985 4706410 1468
Of your soul.

986 4709330 1126
Where am I?

987 4710998 1047
Home.

988 4713000 2924
Where I learned the truth about despair.

989 4716921 1343
As will you.

990 4718881 3595
There is a reason why this prison
is the worst hell on earth:

991 4723260 1377
Hope.

992 4724803 3129
Every man who has rotted here
over the centuries...

993 4728098 3425
...has looked up to the light
and imagined climbing to freedom.

994 4732603 1343
So easy.

995 4734855 1252
So simple.

996 4737066 5598
And like shipwrecked men turning
to seawater from uncontrollable thirst...

997 4744740 1968
...many have died trying.

998 4747576 3721
I learned here there can be
no true despair without hope.

999 4753165 2674
So as I terrorize Gotham...

1000 4756001 3971
...I will feed its people hope
to poison their souls.

1001 4760381 2549
I will let them believe
that they can survive...

1002 4763092 5973
...so that you can watch them clambering
over each other to stay in the sun.

1003 4771892 3129
You can watch me torture an entire city.

1004 4775688 3630
And then when you have truly understood
the depth of your failure...

1005 4779608 2970
...we will fulfill Ra's Al Ghul's destiny.

1006 4786240 1923
We will destroy Gotham.

1007 4789451 2469
And then, when it is done...

1008 4792371 1627
...and Gotham is...

1009 4795833 1377
...ashes...

1010 4802881 2753
...then you have my permission to die.

1011 4819940 1502
You're looking her up in here?

1012 4821608 3846
The Dent Act allows non-segregation
based on extraordinary need.

1013 4825612 3095
First time she broke out
of women's correctional, she was 16.

1014 4828866 1172
Little closer, baby.

1015 4830200 2094
Why, honey?
You wanna hold my hand?

1016 4833662 1718
She's gonna be fine.

1017 4836248 3174
I still don't see the need of a board
meeting for the energy project.

1018 4839585 1593
Bruce got a lot of things right.

1019 4841337 2503
Keeping the board in the dark
was not one of them.

1020 4846425 1468
How good of you to join us.

1021 4848594 2628
Chair.
President.

1022 4851388 3675
All I need now is one more
ordinary board member.

1023 4855225 3425
Mr. Fox, would you like to nominate?

1024 4858812 1252
No.

1025 4860230 1502
I will volunteer.

1026 4862149 1673
Where are you taking us?

1027 4874453 2844
You were right, commissioner.
Will you excuse us, please?

1028 4877623 1047
What happened?

1029 4878832 2128
Your masked man kidnapped
the Wayne Enterprises board.

1030 4881126 2924
He let most of them go,
but he took three into the sewers.

1031 4884213 2344
No more patrols. No more hide and seek.

1032 4886715 2719
Get every available cop down there
and smoke him out!

1033 4889593 1547
The mayor won't want panic.

1034 4891303 2173
So it's a training exercise.

1035 4895891 2423
I'm sorry I didn't take you seriously.

1036 4899103 1047
Not you.

1037 4900312 2378
You're telling me the Batman's gone...

1038 4902856 4722
...so you chase up the Daggett leads
any way you can.

1039 4907903 1047
Yes, sir.

1040 4919373 5473
He asks how much you would pay us
to let you die.

1041 4925003 2002
I told him. I told him you have nothing.

1042 4927756 1252
Do it for the pleasure.

1043 4929508 2970
They pay me more than that
to keep you alive.

1044 4940269 1843
He will try the climb.

1045 4956577 2469
Has anyone ever made it?

1046 4959955 1468
Of course not.

1047 4971925 2378
He says there is one who did.

1048 4975220 1593
A child.

1049 4978056 2048
A child born in this hell.

1050 4981018 1593
Bane.

1051 4982811 3095
An old legend. Nothing more.

1052 4989693 1172
Don't.

Whatever it is they want you to see,
it's happening soon.

There are eight others waiting.

1058 5061765 1468
I won't do it.

1059 5063725 1047
All right, stop.

1060 5066311 2924
Lucius, you'll kill this man,
and yourself...

1061 5069398 1798
...and you'll barely slow them down.

1062 5097801 2219
Go on, then.
Do your work.

1063 5103015 2128
Take them up to the surface.

1064 5105309 1877
People of their status...

1065 5107352 5257
...deserve to experience
the next era of western civilization.

1066 5116612 4130
I've been to half of Daggett's cement
plants and locations they poured underground.

1067 5120907 2378
Anything strange about the pourings?

1068 5123827 3425
Honestly, commissioner, I don't know
anything about civil engineering.

1069 5127414 2924
But you know about patterns.
Keep looking.

1070 5135756 1126
It's done.

1071 5137049 4346
This is now a 4-megaton nuclear bomb.

1072 5142638 2753
Pull the core out of the reactor.

1073 5146933 1877
No, you cannot.

1074 5149144 3675
This is the only power source
capable of sustaining it.

1075 5153231 3846
If you move it,
the core will decay in a matter of months.

1076 5157235 2173
Five, by my calculations.

1077 5159571 1673
And then it will go off!

1078 5163033 3971
And for the sake of your children,
Dr. Pavel...

1079 5167162 2253
...indeed I hope it does.

1080 5170082 2674
Hey. Hey!

1081 5174711 3129
That was you in front
of the stock exchange, wasn't it?

1082 5178465 1673
When?
- When?

1083 5180300 4301
When cops were trying to pull onto Castle
Street and your truck was shutting them out.

1084 5184763 3550
Oh, yeah. You're the cop.
- Detective now.

1085 5188475 4005
And, uh, as a detective, we're not
allowed to believe in coincidence.

1086 5202239 3004
What were you doing here?
What are you working on?

1087 5212749 1547
Commissioner, it's Blake.

1088 5214459 4551
I got two dead witnesses
and a lot of questions. Call me whenev...

1089 5219423 3345
Wait a minute. I'm looking at
four barrels of polyisobutylene.

1090 5224553 2253
That looks like motor oil right next to it.

1091 5226972 3220
Jesus, they're not making cement.
They're making explosives.

1092 5237899 2753
Patch me in to Foley.
- Foley's overseeing the operation.

1093 5240819 1343
They're heading into a trap!

1094 5243405 2628
We're seeing thousands of police
heading into the sewers.

1095 5246199 3470
Mr. Mayor? Literally thousands.
- It's a training exercise, that's all.

1096 5249828 4050
Now if you'll excuse me, I've got tickets
to watch our boys thrash Rapid City.

1097 5255792 2002
Foley.
- It's a trap! Pull everyone out!

1098 5257961 1547
Bane has been pouring concrete...

What so proudly we hailed
At the twilight's...

1102 5278273 3755
There's a ring around the tunnels!
They'll blow it and trap the cops underground!

1103 5283111 2844
Pull them out. Pull them out now!

Sir, are you okay? I'm a police officer.
I need your car right now.

1126 5539534 2002
Clear the corners, rookie.

1127 5542662 1252
Get my coat, son.

And what...?
What is this?

1138 5584162 3880
It's a fully primed neutron bomb...

1139 5588208 2378
...with a blast radius of six miles.

1140 5591419 3379
And who is capable of disarming
such a device?

1141 5596883 1297
Only me.

1142 5598927 1627
Only you.

1143 5601554 2298
Thank you, good doctor!

1144 5606434 3300
Now, this bomb is armed!

1145 5609896 2594
And this bomb is mobile!

1146 5612649 4551

is a mystery.

1147 5617537 4847

Now, we come here
not as conquerors...

1149 5626352 5598

1150 5633151 4722

1151 5638573 3800

attempting to flee...

1152 5644287 2628
...this anonymous Gothamite...

1153 5647081 4881

People of Gotham,
we have not abandoned you.

1178 5774250 1343
What does that mean?

1179 5776210 2298
It means we're on our own.

Then he'll show his true colors.

1185 5791684 1627
And you'll be dead.

1186 5811954 5097
Behind you stands a symbol of oppression.

1187 5817668 1468
Blackgate Prison...

1188 5819295 3595

1190 5826719 2094
Harvey Dent.

1191 5829555 2594
Who has been held up to you...

1192 5832308 4506
...as the shining example of justice!

1193 5836979 3004
We're just gonna keep moving you

...tearing down this corrupt city!

1196 5846864 1627
Yes! Yes! Yes!

1197 5848658 3630
Let me tell you the truth
about Harvey Dent.

1198 5852453 4847
From the words of Gotham's
police commissioner...

1199 5857458 2378
...James Gordon:

1200 5860420 3345
'The Batman didn't murder Harvey Dent.

1201 5863923 1923
He saved my boy...

1202 5866050 4426
...then took the blame
for Harvey's appalling crimes...

1203 5870638 2628
...so that I could, to my shame...

1204 5873433 3630
...build a lie around this...

1205 5877228 2719
...fallen idol.

1206 5882233 4927
I praised the madman
who tried to murder my own child.

1207 5887363 3755
Well, I can no longer live with my lie.

1208 5891284 3755
It is time to trust the people of Gotham
with the truth...

1209 5895204 4096
...and it is time for me to resign.'

1210 5900251 3345
And do you accept this man's resignation?

1211 5905381 4221
And do you accept the resignation
of all of these liars?

1212 5909760 1673
Of all the corrupt?

1213 5915224 2253
Those men locked up for
eight years in Blackgate...

1214 5917643 4255
...and denied parole under the Dent Act,
it was based on a lie.

1215 5922940 1627
Gotham needed a hero.

1216 5924734 4221
Well, it needs it now more than ever,
but you betrayed everything you stood for.

1217 5930865 5678
There's a point far out there
when the structures fail you...

1218 5936704 2879
...when the rules aren't
weapons any more...

1219 5940291 3470
...they're shackles,
letting the bad guy get ahead.

1220 5945421 3425
One day, you may face...

1221 5949008 1673

I hope you have a friend like I did...

He says you must first fix your back.

1249 6105665 1126
How does he know?

1250 6106957 1422
He was the prison doctor.

1251 6108542 3880
He's a morphine addict
who incurred the displeasure...

1252 6112588 3925
...of powerful people,
including your masked friend.

1253 6117426 1502
How?

1254 6120179 4301
Many years ago, it was a time of plague.

1255 6126060 3095
Some of the other prisoners attacked Bane.

1256 6131190 3675
The doctor's fumbling attempts
to repair the damage...

1257 6135653 1627
...left him in perpetual agony.

1258 6137446 3174
The mask holds the pain at bay.

1259 6140783 3345
Bane was the child you spoke of?

1260 6144286 1297
He was born here?

1261 6146539 4471
The legend is that there was a mercenary
who worked for a local warlord.

1262 6151752 2344
He fell in love with
the warlord's daughter.

1263 6154588 1593
They were married in secret.

1264 6156340 2002
When the warlord found out...

1265 6158843 3846
...the mercenary was condemned to this pit.

1266 6163264 2253
But then he exiled him instead.

1267 6165683 4050
The mercenary understood that it was
the daughter who had secured his release.

1268 6169895 4881
But what he could not know
was the true price of his freedom.

1269 6175818 1798
She took his place in the pit.

1270 6180740 1547
And she was with child...

1271 6182450 1923
...the mercenary's child.

1272 6186954 3220
Innocence cannot flower underground.
It has to be stamped out.

1273 6192793 5973
One day, the doctor forgot
to lock the cell.

1274 6205514 2344
But the child had a friend...

1275 6208309 5473
...a protector who showed the others
that this innocence was their redemption.

1276 6213939 1718
It was to be prized.

1277 6215816 1752
The mother was not so lucky.

1278 6220738 3675
This is Bane's prison now.
He wouldn't want this story told.

1279 6235795 3721
There's a vertebra protruding
from your back.

1280 6239882 2094
It has to be put back.

1281 6246972 2799
Stay like this until you stand.

1282 6257066 5632
Did you not think I would return, Bruce?
Hmm?

1283 6268369 1627
I told you I was immortal.

1284 6272540 2128
I watched... I watched you die.

1285 6274834 2970
Oh, there are many forms of immortality.

1286 6279713 1468
Once, I had a wife...

1287 6282716 1718
...my great love.

1288 6285803 3379
She was taken from me.
- You were the mercenary.

1289 6293227 1968

No.

1294 6304947 3425
You yourself fought the decadence
of Gotham for years...

1295 6308534 1923
...with all your strength...

1296 6310828 4221
...all your resources,
all your moral authority.

1297 6315791 3004
And the only victory you could
achieve was a lie.

1298 6319420 2879
Now you understand.
Gotham is beyond saving.

1299 6322464 1126
No.

1300 6323757 2128
And must be allowed to die.
- No!

1301 6332808 2002
Yeah, just lift your head.

1302 6335227 1422
Oh, that's good.

1303 6342484 1047
No, no!

1304 6378896 2344
What's that?
- This was someone's home.

1305 6381398 1923
And now it's everyone's home.

1306 6385110 3049
There's a storm coming, remember?
This is what you wanted.

1307 6417267 2799
It's for the bus,
in case there's a chance to evacuate.

1308 6420229 1547
Any news? Is the commissioner...?

1309 6421939 3345
The less you know, Father.
How are the boys doing?

1310 6425442 2799
Well, we've had more power on,
so they've got some TV.

1311 6428404 1343
It's good to see you.

1312 6430447 4050
Blake, you be careful out there.
They're hunting down cops like dogs.

1313 6440207 1297
Why build yourself?

1314 6443836 4972
I'm not meant to die in here.
- Here, there. What's the difference?

1316 6510527 3345
I told you it could not be done.

1317 6514031 1627
You told me a child did it.

1318 6517034 2298
But no ordinary child.

1319 6519495 2799
A child born in hell.

1320 6526627 1468
Forged from suffering.

1321 6530214 2298
Hardened by pain.

1322 6534051 2628
Not a man from privilege.

1323 6555739 1968
We got boots on the ground, sir.

1324 6558492 1092
Just waiting on intel.

1325 6565290 1047
You have ID?

1326 6567042 1047
Of course not.

1327 6568252 2549
Well, how can we trust you?
- We don't have any choice.

1328 6571672 2344
Commissioner Gordon.
Captain Jones, Special Forces.

1329 6574174 1547
Captain. Glad to have you here.

1330 6575884 2674
It's our job, sir.
Now, uh, how many of you are there?

1331 6578720 2924
Well, there's dozens.
I'd rather not say exactly.

1332 6581807 3254
But the men trapped underground
number almost 3000.

1333 6585227 1923
Condition?
- Getting food and water.

1334 6587312 2298
Can we break them out?
- Yes, sir.

1335 6589773 2344
Take out the mercenaries
south of Ackerman Park.

1336 6592276 2719
Blow the rubble, make a hole
big enough for 10 at a time.

1337 6595154 3220
I'm in contact with my partner
who's down there. They're just waiting.

1338 6598532 4255
Men who haven't seen daylight in months?
- Officers who haven't seen daylight in months.

1339 6602953 2674
What about the bomb? Satellite
can't pick up radiation hot spots.

1340 6606165 3379
They keep it on a truck.
It must have a lead-lined roof.

1341 6609710 2674
They move it constantly.
- Good. So you know the truck?

1342 6612546 3345
Well, it's one of three.
We've been tracking it.

1343 6616258 1047
Decoy.

1344 6618844 3425
You don't really think he's coming back?
- Doesn't matter what I think.

1345 6622431 3880
Actually, it does. You should put your
faith in something a little more real.

1346 6626476 3220
The routes don't vary much.
- Okay. What about the triggerman?

1347 6629855 4050
No leads. It's a bluff. Bane wouldn't give
control of that bomb to someone else.

1348 6634067 4221
We can't take that chance. Until we have
the triggerman, we just track the device.

1349 6638447 3925
And meanwhile, Gotham lives under
a warlord, like some failed state?

1350 6642534 2879
Dial it back, officer.
This situation is unprecedented.

1351 6645579 5257
We can't do anything to risk millions of lives.
- You gonna tell him what's really going on?

1352 6651001 3095
Captain, the situation is more
complicated than you think.

1353 6654254 2219
There's someone you need to meet.

1354 6656798 3880
Came upstairs looking for a vantage point.
Found the people who run the corporation.

1355 6660844 1172
What corporation?

1356 6662179 2378
Wayne Enterprises. You good?

1357 6673607 2173
Mr. Fox, would you like to brief
the captain?

1358 6675984 2594
Miss Tate's fully aware of the situation.

1359 6678737 4471
And as CEO of Wayne Enterprises,
I have to take responsibility for it.

1360 6683367 2002
Why?
- We built it.

1361 6685535 1502
You built the bomb?

1362 6687204 4176
It was built as a fusion reactor.
First of its kind.

1363 6691541 3379
Bane turned the core into a bomb
and removed it from the reactor.

1364 6695087 3379
Here's the important part.
- As the device's fuel cells deteriorate...

1365 6698632 1923
...it becomes increasingly unstable...

1366 6700717 1547
...to the point of detonation.

1367 6702427 1752
This bomb is a time bomb.

1368 6704346 4005
And it will go off in 23 days,
regardless of Bane's revolution...

1369 6708517 2719
...or what we, or the outside world,
choose to do.

1370 6711395 2594
So your plan might not be
as practical as you thought.

1371 6714523 4471
Could you disarm it?
- I could reconnect it to the reactor. Stabilize it.

1372 6719152 3129
Let's move from this location and call it in.
- Right. Let's go.

1373 6722447 3220
No, no, we'll take it from here.
You stay and look after these folks.

1374 6733000 1252
Someone sold us out.

1375 6735877 1468
Go, go, go!

1376 6758650 2094
I'll die before I talk.

1377 6761445 2253
I'm on your schedule, captain.

1378 6770162 2344
There were people living upstairs.

1379 6772998 2128
Round them up for judgment...

1380 6778962 4881
...and hang them where the world can see.

1381 6785886 4801
Police have cordoned off the entire
Central Heights and East Park Side areas...

1382 6790849 4096
...as well as Merchant and South Shoreline
Boulevards in an attempt...

1383 6798565 4050
He says the leap to freedom
is not about strength.

1384 6803070 1968
My body makes the jump.

1385 6805530 3880
Survival is the spirit. The soul.

1386 6812329 2970
My soul is as ready to escape as my body.

1387 6815457 3004
Fear is why you fail.

1388 6818752 1547
No, I'm not afraid.

1389 6821963 1502
I'm angry.

1390 6852702 1468
Bruce.

1391 6855372 1092
Why do we fall?

1392 6862504 1877
You do not fear death.

1393 6865424 4551
You think this makes you strong.
It makes you weak.

1394 6870512 1047
Why?

1395 6871721 2253
How can you move faster than possible...

1396 6874266 2469
...fight longer than possible...

1397 6877018 3595
...without the most powerful impulse
of the spirit?

1398 6881857 1627
The fear of death.

1399 6884192 1877
I do fear death.

1400 6887863 1968
I fear dying in here...

1401 6890615 1923
...while my city burns.

1402 6893577 1923
There's no one there to save it.

1403 6896872 1502
Then make the climb.

1404 6903420 1343
How?

1405 6906256 1798
As the child did...

1406 6912762 1673
...without the rope.

1407 6917100 2298
Then fear will find you again.

1408 6926401 2253
Ah, supplies for your journey?

1409 6928820 2094
Oh, that's wonderful. That's...

1410 6935452 1627
What does that mean?

1411 6937621 1252
Rise.

1412 6940207 1047
No.

No, there's been a mistake!

Take me to Bane!

1416 7037887 1673
I want to see Bane!

1417 7042809 1092
Order!

1418 7044060 2753
This is a mistake! Where is Bane?

1419 7046980 2128
There's been no mistake, Mr. Stryver.

1420 7049482 2423
You are Philip Stryver...

1421 7052068 3504
...executive vice president
of Daggett Industries...

1422 7055739 3630
...who for years has been living off
the blood and sweat...

1423 7059534 2219
...of people less powerful than him.

1424 7061911 3095
Call Bane. I am one of you.

1425 7065248 3550
Bane has no authority here.
This is merely a sentencing hearing.

1426 7068960 2128
Now, the choice is yours.

1427 7071254 2423
Exile or death!

1428 7078303 1422
Order!

1429 7080305 1297
Exi... Exile.

1430 7082349 1422
Sold.

1431 7083933 1752
To the man in the cold sweat.

1432 7093068 1422
You follow the thick ice.

1433 7094653 2128
You try to swim, you're dead in minutes.

1434 7096946 1593
Has anyone made it?

1435 7111961 2423
Where are they?
It's not like we have a lot of time.

1436 7114839 1126
How long?

1437 7116132 1843
The bomb goes off tomorrow.

1438 7118385 3004
We have about 18 hours to do something.
- To do what?

1439 7121554 4005
To mark the truck. Get a GPS on it so we
can start to figure out how to bring it down.

1440 7132273 1252
That's it?

1441 7136027 1092
Foley.

1442 7138655 3925
Where's Foley, damn it?
- You shouldn't be out on the streets.

1443 7147288 2924
Jim, he's not here.
- You let your wife come to the door?

1444 7150375 3049
When the city's under occupation?
- Wait in the kitchen, honey.

1445 7153586 2628
What did you do,
bury your uniform in the backyard?

1446 7156381 2128
You saw what they did
to those Special Forces.

1447 7158675 2344
Have you forgotten all the years
we were out on patrol?

1448 7161177 3129
When every gangbanger wanted to plant one
as soon as our backs were turned?

1449 7164472 4130
That was different. These guys run the city.
The government's done a deal with them.

1450 7168768 2549
Bane's got their balls in a vice.
That's not a deal.

1451 7171479 3300
You move on Bane,
the triggerman is gonna hit the button.

1452 7174941 3971
You think he's given control of that bomb
to one of the people?

1453 7179070 2002
You think this is part of some revolution?

1454 7181239 2844
There's one man with his finger
on the button. That's Bane.

1455 7184242 3095
Look, we've all got to keep our heads
down till they can fix this.

1456 7187495 3630
If you still had a family here...
- This only gets fixed from inside...

1457 7191291 1593
...the city!

1458 7193209 1673
Look, Peter.

1459 7195837 4597
I'm not asking you to walk down Grand in your
dress blues, but something has to be done.

1460 7200592 2048
Sorry, Jim. I gotta...
- Keep your head down?

1461 7202802 2173
What goods that gonna do
when that thing blows?

1462 7205138 2469
You don't know that's gonna happen.

1463 7211770 2298
I hear you're looking for men,
commissioner.

1464 7214230 1252
How about me instead?

1465 7215648 2594
Miss Tate, I, uh, can't ask you to do that.

1466 7219194 1047
Please.

1467 7221821 2173
You little punk!
What'd you take?

1468 7224157 2298
Nothing!
I didn't take anything!

1469 7226618 3300
You steal from us, you little bastard?

1470 7230497 4005
Now, you boys know you can't come into
my neighborhood without asking politely.

1471 7240423 3254
Never steal anything from someone
you can't outrun, kid.

1472 7250350 2048
You're pretty generous for a thief.

1473 7261069 2753
I thought they killed you.
- Not yet.

1474 7264155 3174
If you're expecting an apology, I...
- It wouldn't suit you.

1475 7268743 1047
I need your help.

1476 7270328 1468
And why would I help you?

1477 7271955 2002
For this. Clean slate.

1478 7274123 2002
You'd trust me with that?

1479 7276709 1627
After what I did to you?

1480 7278503 2924
I'll admit, I was a little let down.

1481 7283049 3129
But I still think there's more to you.
In fact, I think that for you...

1482 7286594 1343
...this isn't just a tool.

1483 7288096 3220
It's an escape route.
You want to disappear. Start fresh.

1484 7292225 2970
I can't even get off this island.
- I can give you a way off...

1485 7295353 1547
...once you get me to Lucius Fox.

1486 7297063 2799
Find out where they're holding him
and take me in.

1487 7303611 1092
Why do you need Fox?

1488 7304863 2503
To save the city.
- Who says it needs saving?

1489 7307532 1593
Maybe I like it this way.

1490 7309284 1627
Maybe you do...

1491 7312287 2344
...but tomorrow that bomb's going off.

1492 7317208 1718
Got your powerful friend on the case?

1493 7319085 1343
I'm trying...

1494 7321254 1627
...but I need Fox.

1495 7323047 1752
As it approaches...

1496 7325592 1172
...flip the switch.

1497 7326926 3550
The needle hits 200, you give me the
signal, I'll mark the truck. Okay?

1498 7331848 1627
Heads up, heads up.

1499 7349574 2298
I got it.
- Mercenaries on your 6.

1500 7352035 3129
Stand still! Keep your hands
where we can see them!

1501 7357373 2048
Commissioner Gordon,
you are under arrest.

1502 7359584 1718
On whose authority?

1503 7361461 1217
The people of Gotham.

1504 7363671 4927
No lawyer? No witnesses?
What sort of due process is this?

1505 7368760 3220
Your guilt has been determined,
this is merely a sentencing hearing.

1506 7372388 1593
Now, what will it be?

1507 7375183 2719
Death or exile?

1508 7378061 4756
Crane, if you think we're going out
onto that ice willingly...

1509 7382982 1593
...you have another thing coming.

1510 7387070 1343
Death, then.

1511 7388571 2219
Looks that way.
- Very well.

1512 7390949 1502
Death...

1513 7393785 1718
...by exile.

1514 7398081 1468
Bring her to me.

1515 7406047 4221
Hey, we're going now.
Blake says they're ready! Get your gear on!

1516 7410426 3049
Hey, you hear me?
We're going now. Let's do it.

1517 7417600 2253
Find this one a spot, got
a big day tomorrow.

1518 7420019 3174
We all do.
It's not every day you bag Bruce Wayne.

1519 7425441 1377
Bruce.
- You okay?

1520 7426985 2378
Picked a hell of a time to go on vacation,
Mr. Wayne.

1521 7429529 1673
How long until that core ignites?

1522 7431364 3846
That bomb goes off in 12 hours.
- Unless we can reconnect it to the reactor.

1523 7435952 3129
Can you get Miranda out of here?
- Not tonight. I'm sorry.

1524 7439872 2253
Do what's necessary.
- Tonight I need you.

1525 7442291 2423
What for?
- To get me back in the game.

1526 7444877 4176
Sorry to spoil things, boys,
but Bane wants these guys to himself.

1527 7451384 3095
I won't forget about you, Miranda.
- I know.

1528 7463771 1798
I like your girlfriend, Mr. Wayne.

1529 7465732 1843
He should be so lucky.

1530 7473322 2753
Any move I make on Bane or the bomb...

1531 7476242 1877
...the triggerman sets it off.

1532 7478286 2799
Well, they won't use radio or cell.
Too much interference.

1533 7481247 1673
Infrared doesn't have the range.

1534 7483082 2753
It'll have to be a microburst. Longwave.

1535 7486002 1798
Could you block it?
- Yes.

1536 7487962 3630
But I'll need the EMP cannon
guidance mount from the Bat.

1537 7492759 1627
Remember where you parked?

1538 7508775 1468
She fly okay?

Yeah, even without the autopilot.

Okay. It's clear. Come on, quick.
One at a time.

1543 7563579 1343
Wait, wait!

1544 7566249 1468
Ross!

1545 7567875 1377
Ross?

1546 7569877 2094
Lock it up.
- No, keep down.

1547 7572630 1593
Get down!

1548 7575842 1252
Who are you?

1549 7606497 1297
Light it up.

1550 7625766 3174
Dad, check it out.
- Honey, come take a look.

1551 7639322 1718
Impossible.

1552 7641824 1752
Keep her close.

1553 7644243 1673
He'll come for her.

1554 7646245 1752
Where's Miranda Tate?

1555 7648664 1468
Bane took her.

1556 7650333 3300
He's holed up at city hall,
surrounded by his army.

1557 7653920 2503
This blocks the remote detonator signal
to the bomb.

1558 7656589 3675
Get it onto it before sunrise.
They might hit the button when it starts.

1559 7661177 1172
When what starts?

1560 7662845 1217
War.

1561 7699924 1126
You missed a spot.

1562 7704637 4881
If you're working alone, wear a mask.
- I'm not afraid to be seen standing up to them.

1563 7709684 3220
The mask is not for you.
It's to protect the people you care about.

1564 7714605 1968
Count to five, then throw.

1565 7726951 2674
No offense, but you got
something bigger in that belt?

1566 7740047 3129
What now?
- All-out assault on Bane.

1567 7743342 2253
But you need to get people
across the bridge.

1568 7745761 2253
Why?
- In case we fail.

1569 7748180 2719
Lead an exodus.
Save as many lives as you can.

1570 7751058 1297
You don't need me here?

1571 7752518 1547
You've given me an army.

1572 7754228 1172
Now go.

1573 7756147 1092
Hey, thanks.

1574 7757398 1343
Don't thank me yet.

1575 7758899 2048
Well, I might not get a chance later.

1576 7774790 1718
You shouldn't have.

1577 7777460 2173
The midtown tunnel's
blocked by debris...

1578 7779795 3379
...but the cannons have enough firepower
to make a path for people.

1579 7783341 1843
Wait until the fighting begins.

1580 7785343 2719
You're gonna wage a war
to save your stuck-up girlfriend?

1581 7788220 1047
To start it, throttle...

1582 7791057 3174
I got it.
- We have 45 minutes to save this city.

1583 7794393 2753
No, I've got 45 minutes to get clear
of the blast radius.

1584 7797313 3300
You don't stand a chance against these guys.
- With your help, I might.

1585 7800775 2378
I'll open that tunnel, then I'm gone.

1586 7804236 1593
There's more to you than that.

1587 7809492 2094
Sorry to keep letting you down.

1588 7815247 1547
Come with me.

1589 7818084 1593
Save yourself.

1590 7821921 2719
You don't owe these people any more.

1591 7824799 2128
You've given them everything.

1592 7827093 1468
Not everything.

1593 7828969 1252
Not yet.

1594 7870261 1673
Disperse!

1595 7872096 2219
Disperse or be fired upon!

1596 7875724 2378
There's only one police in this town.

1597 7917099 1673
Open fire.

1600 8001559 4096
So you came back to die with your city.

1601 8005980 3800
No. I came back to stop you.

1602 8020828 1047
Now!

1603 8034800 1627
That's impossible.

1604 8038304 1627
Cut over to Fifth!

1605 8053986 2002
Here you go. Get on the bus. Go ahead.

1606 8056155 2594
You, come with me. You too.

1607 8058949 3049
Hey, you, you, and you,
come here, come here.

1608 8062161 1843
Everyone else get on the bus, okay?

1609 8064163 2674
You guys, you go knock on doors
and spread the word, okay?

1610 8066999 3880
The bomb is gonna go off. Get out by
the South Street tunnel or over the bridge.

1611 8071045 2719
You do two blocks and you get back
to the bus, all right?

1612 8073922 1877
Go, go, go!

1613 8075966 1377
Is he back?

1614 8078719 1343
Keep your eyes open. Go, go.

1615 8162678 1547
Cover the doors!

1616 8167391 1547
Where's your trigger?!

1617 8169268 1627
Where is it?!

1618 8171812 2844
You'd never give it
to an ordinary citizen!

1619 8174815 2628
Where is it? Where's your trigger?

1620 8178819 2719
Where is it?! Where is it?!

1621 8189329 2128
Tell me where the trigger is.

1622 8191957 3595
Then you have my permission to die.

1623 8207681 1718
I broke you.

1624 8210684 1877
How have you come back?

1625 8212728 4506
You think you're the only one who could
learn the strength to escape?

1626 8217399 1297
Where's the trigger?

1627 8219359 2344
But I never escaped.

1628 8222571 1547
But the child.

1629 8225908 2048
The child of Ra's Al Ghul made the climb.

1630 8228118 2378
But he's not the child of Ra's Al Ghul.

1631 8234416 1343
I am.

1632 8236210 2423
And though I'm not ordinary...

1633 8239963 1718
...I am a citizen.

1634 8261276 1172
Miranda?

1635 8265322 1047
Why?

1636 8267115 1343
Talia.

1637 8269284 3049
My mother named me Talia,
before she was killed...

1638 8273163 3425
...the way I would have been killed,
if not for my protector...

1639 8277042 1047
...Bane.

1640 8286051 1172
Goodbye.

1641 8289471 2128
I climbed out of the pit.

1642 8297563 1798
I found my father...

1643 8302317 3129
...and brought him back
to exact terrible vengeance.

1644 8306321 1752
But by that time...

1645 8309199 3755
...the prisoners and doctor had done
their work to my friend.

1646 8313120 1217
My protector.

1647 8318333 1502
The League took us in.

1648 8320210 1547
Trained us.

1649 8322129 2799
But my father could not accept Bane.

1650 8325465 1752
He saw only a monster.

1651 8327384 5882
His very existence was a reminder
of the hell he'd left his wife to die in.

1652 8333682 3129
He excommunicated Bane
from the League of Shadows.

1653 8336977 4551
His only crime was that he loved me.

1654 8343317 2924
I could not forgive my father.

1655 8350866 1673
Until you murdered him.

Innocent is a strong word
to throw around Gotham, Bruce.

1659 8382397 3049
I honor my father by finishing his work.

1660 8397621 4881
Vengeance against the man who killed him
is simply a reward for my patience.

1661 8404002 1092
You see...

1662 8406630 1343
...it's the slow knife...

1663 8408131 2628
...the knife that takes its time.

1664 8414554 1217
The knife...

1665 8416598 3595
...that waits years without forgetting...

1666 8420477 3300
...then slips quietly between the bones.

1667 8424815 1297
That's the knife...

1668 8427442 1343
...that cuts deepest.

1669 8428944 1126
Please.

1670 8437786 2002
Maybe your knife...

1671 8440789 1422
...was too slow.

1672 8442374 1422
The truck is under attack.

1673 8443959 3755
Gordon.
You gave him a way to block my signal.

1674 8447879 1047
No matter.

1675 8451466 2094
He's bought Gotham 11 minutes.

1676 8457931 1502
Come on!

1677 8460058 1422
This Way!

1678 8467065 2423
Stay there!
What are you doing?

1679 8469943 3345
Blake, MCU!
I'm getting these boys to safety!

1680 8473447 1343
You'll get us all killed!

1681 8474948 3004
If anyone crosses this bridge,
they'll blow the city!

1682 8478118 3379
It's gonna blow anyway!
We need to open this bridge, now!

1683 8481663 3174
Detective, if you take one step forward
we will shoot you!

1684 8485000 3595
If you take two steps forward,
we will blow the bridge!

1685 8490672 3300
Okay, go back by the bus and wait for me,
all right? Go back and wait.

1686 8497220 3971
Prepare a convoy. We must secure
the bomb until it detonates.

1687 8502517 3721
Don't kill him,
I want him to feel the heat.

1688 8506980 4881
Feel the fire of 12
million souls you failed.

1689 8517783 1547
Goodbye, my friend.

1690 8527417 1377
Goodbye.

1691 8529336 3504
Keep moving forward!
Flank them at the stairs!

1692 8541056 1752
Shoot them.

1693 8543475 1468
Shoot them all.

1694 8554152 3630
We both know that I have to kill you now.

1695 8560700 2219
You'll just have to imagine the fire.

1696 8570752 2048
About the whole no-guns thing...

1697 8573755 3049
...I'm not sure I feel as strongly
about it as you do.

1698 8590188 1627
Pull up.

1699 8594526 1422
Stay level.

1700 8608331 3300
We have to force that convoy east
to the entrance to the reactor.

1701 8613461 3004
I need you on the ground,
I'll be in the air. Go.

1702 8616715 3254
The situation has changed.
Your orders are out of date.

1703 8620677 3470
I'm a cop, like you,
and I'm walking out there.

1704 8624973 2094
Please do not shoot me!

1705 8629019 1126
Shoot at his feet.

1706 8640155 2344
Nothing like a little air superiority.

1707 8642657 2094
Detective! Please stop!

1708 8645327 3095
Please, detective! Stop!

1709 8648580 1843
Stop walking!

1710 8651291 2719
Blow it!
Do it!

1711 8665305 2378
You have to get that bomb here.
You've got 10 minutes.

1712 8678652 2298
They're pushing us
to the entrance of the reactor.

1713 8681112 2469
They're gonna try to reconnect the core.

1714 8684866 1547
You idiots!

1715 8686701 1798
You sons of bitches!

1716 8688662 1752
You're killing us!
