The world of investing can be a jungle.

2 50521 1709
Bulls. Bears.

3 52856 1334
Danger at every turn.

4 54733 5588
That's why we at Stratton Oakmont
pride ourselves on being the best.

5 60614 4253
Trained professionals to guide you
through the financial wilderness.

6 65285 1668
Stratton Oakmont.

7 67538 1375
Stability.

8 69373 1334
Integrity.

9 71417 1166
Pride.

10 74962 1041
One!

11 76714 1083
Two!

12 78298 1167
Three!

13 85264 3210
Twenty-five grand to the first
cocksucker to nail a bull's-eye!

14 89810 1500
Come on! Let's go!

15 92730 1250
One!

16 94440 1041
Two!

17 96442 1250
Three!

18 98235 2084
My name is Jordan Belfort.

19 100404 1208
Not him.

20 101739 1667
Me. That's right.

21 103490 1876
I'm a former member
of the middle class

22 105451 3877
raised by two accountants
in a tiny apartment in Bayside, Queens.

23 109747 3335
The year I turned 26,
as the head of my own brokerage firm,

24 113167 2626
I made $49 million,

25 115878 3419
which really pissed me off because
it was three shy of a million a week.

26 123635 1960
No, no, no. My Ferrari was white,

27 125679 3169
like Don Johnson's in Miami Vice.
Not red.

28 133187 2209
See that humongous estate down there?

29 135481 1333
That's my house.

30 137024 1417
For millionaires whose ships...

31 138525 4254
My wife, Naomi,
the Duchess of Bay Ridge, Brooklyn,

32 142863 2126
a former model and Miller Lite girl.

33 145949 1167
Yeah.

34 147201 2543
She was the one with my cock
in her mouth in the Ferrari.

35 149828 2543
So put your dick back in your pants.

36 152539 2627
In addition to Naomi
and my two perfect kids,

37 155250 1876
I own a mansion, private jet,

38 157211 1625
six cars, three horses,

39 158921 3586
two vacation homes,
and a 170-foot yacht.

40 163717 1709
Anchors aweigh!

41 169014 3169
I also gamble like a degenerate.
I drink like a fish.

42 172267 2794
I fuck hookers maybe
five, six times a week.

43 175145 2835
I have three different federal agencies
looking to indict me.

44 178148 2585
Oh, yeah, and I love drugs.

45 186114 1126
Okay.

46 187991 1501
- One more round.
- Oh, yeah.

47 189576 1834
- Oh, you like it?
- Yeah.

48 203006 2085
Pull up. Pull up!
We're gonna crash, for Christ sake!

49 205175 1250
Relax!

50 208178 1292
Just relax.

51 220274 2334
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm all right.

52 222985 1292
Good job.

53 225112 1834
You get in there safe, all right?

54 227030 1835
Till the next time, brother.

55 228949 1542
Till next time.

56 236164 3169
Yup, on a daily basis
I consume enough drugs

57 239418 5421
to sedate Manhattan,
Long Island and Queens for a month.

58 245299 1667
Okay, Mr. Jordan.

59 247134 3502
I take Quaaludes 10 to 15 times a day
for my "back pain,"

60 250721 1834
Adderall to stay focused,

61 253098 2460
Xanax to take the edge off,
pot to mellow me out,

62 255642 2961
cocaine to wake me back up again
and morphine, well,

63 258979 1167
because it's awesome.

64 260230 1125
Good morning, Nathan.

65 268113 2502
But of all the drugs
under God's blue heaven,

66 270699 2043
there is one that is my absolute favorite.

67 273994 1334
You see,

68 275954 2835
enough of this shit'll
make you invincible.

69 279416 2168
Able to conquer the world,

70 281668 2126
and eviscerate your enemies.

71 286590 2335
And I'm not talking about this.

72 289509 1418
I'm talking about this.

73 294848 1959
See, money doesn't
just buy you a better life,

74 296892 2501
better food, better cars, better pussy.

75 299478 2293
It also makes you a better person.

76 301855 3586
You can give generously to the church
or political party of your choice.

77 305525 3128
You can save the fucking
spotted owl with money.

78 312866 2794
I always wanted to be rich.
So let me go back.

79 315827 2210
I'm 22 years old, newly married,

80 318205 2501
and already a money-crazed little shit.

81 320791 1167
So what do I do?

82 322042 3336
I go to the one place on Earth
that befit my high-minded ambitions.

83 328048 1000
I love you.

84 339893 2794
You are lower than pond scum.

85 343939 1792
You got a problem with that,

86 346274 1209
Jordan?

87 348110 1542
No. No problem at all.

88 349736 1709
Good. Because that is what you are.

89 351530 1375
Pond scum.

90 352990 1250
Your job is connector,

91 354324 3753
which means that you'll be dialing
the phone over 500 times a day

92 358203 2877
trying to connect me
with wealthy business owners.

93 361164 1960
And until you pass your Series 7,

94 363208 2210
that is all you're gonna
fucking be doing. Sit.

95 365502 1250
Sit!

96 367754 3419
Now just so you know,
last year I made over $300,000.

97 371258 3586
The other guy you'll be working for,
he made over a million.

98 374928 1626
A million dollars?

99 376638 2960
I could only imagine
what a douchebag that guy must be.

100 379766 2835
- Jordan Belfort.
- Yes, sir.

101 382728 1625
- Mark Hanna.
- A pleasure to meet you.

102 384438 2585
And you as well. I see you've
already met the village asshole.

103 387107 1626
Smile and dial.

104 388817 2501
And don't pick up
your fucking head until 1:00.

105 391445 1500
Hey, fuck him.

106 393030 2626
I'm the senior broker here.
He's just a worthless piker.

107 395782 1751
Why don't you blow me, Hanna?

108 397617 3336
Now did you really pitch
a stock in your job interview?

109 401038 1750
I had to do something
to stand out. Right, sir?

110 403790 1751
I fucking love that.

111 406126 1626
- Lunch. Today.
- Yeah.

112 407878 2793
We don't start dialing at 9:30

113 410797 2835
because our clients
are already answering the phone.

114 413717 2626
Three. Two. One.

115 416428 1000
Let's fuck!

116 419222 1876
You want to know
what money sounds like?

117 421183 1959
Go to a trading floor on Wall Street.

118 423226 1459
"Fuck" this, "shit" that.

119 424770 1542
"Cunt," "cock," "asshole."

120 426396 2085
I couldn't believe
how these guys talked to each other.

121 428565 1292
- Good fucking package...
- Piece of shit!

122 429941 1626
I was hooked in seconds.

123 432819 2001
It was like mainlining adrenaline.

124 434905 2293
Yeah. Fuckface, look at
where the stock's at today, huh?

125 437741 2418
You motherfucker,
you can't get any at 44...

126 440327 2209
- Pick up the cocksucking phone!
- Sorry...

127 445290 2168
You are such
a fucking douchebag, Hanna.

128 447542 2752
We don't give two shits
about how technology works

129 450378 2627
because all we care about
is getting fucking rich.

130 453131 1250
- Solid, 2,000.
- Jordan Belfort.

131 456843 1042
Done!

132 458011 1584
Time to paint the tape.

133 460388 3545
2,000. Microsoft. Going in the hole!

134 464059 1250
Come on.

135 466019 3044
Live. Live. Hold on, that is hot.

136 470148 2919
In. In. Shut that motherfucker.
Shut it! Shut it! Shut it!

137 473193 1083
Sold!

138 492587 1125
Yeah.

139 500929 1042
Tootski?

140 502806 1667
Oh, no. Thank you, though.

141 504558 2585
Mr. Hanna, what can I bring for you
on this glorious afternoon?

142 507227 2710
Well, Hector, here's the game plan.

143 510021 2460
You're gonna bring us
two Absolut martinis.

144 512566 1542
You know how I like them. Straight up.

145 514192 2627
And then precisely seven
and one half minutes after that,

146 516903 1334
you're gonna bring us two more.

147 518363 3252
Then two more after that
every five minutes

148 521700 2209
until one of us passes the fuck out.

149 525162 1458
Excellent strategy, sir.

150 526746 1793
I'm good with water for now.

151 528623 1334
Thank you.

152 530041 2877
It's his first day on Wall Street.
Give him time.

153 533503 2210
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

154 536715 1041
Mr. Hanna?

155 538383 5755
You're able to do drugs during the day
and then still function, still do your job?

156 544222 1834
How the fuck else
would you do this job?

157 546141 2168
Cocaine and hookers, my friend.

158 548435 1375
Right.

159 550812 4796
Well, I got to say, I'm incredibly excited
to be a part of your firm. I mean...

160 556193 1375
The clients you have are absolutely...

161 557652 1459
Fuck the clients.

162 559696 3252
Your only responsibility
is to put meat on the table.

163 564034 1250
You got a girlfriend?

164 565368 1543
I'm married. I have a wife.

165 566995 2084
Her name is Teresa. She cuts hair.

166 569164 1292
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

167 570540 1334
Think about Teresa.

168 571958 1167
Name of the game.

169 573251 3795
Move the money from
your client's pocket into your pocket.

170 577172 1042
Right.

171 578298 1667
But if you make your clients
money at the same time,

172 580050 2251
it's advantageous to everyone. Correct?

173 583053 1083
No.

174 585138 2001
Number one rule of Wall Street.

175 587974 1334
Nobody...

176 589434 2126
I don't care if you're Warren Buffett
or if you're Jimmy Buffett.

177 591645 4628
Nobody knows if a stock is gonna go up,
down, sideways, or in fucking circles.

178 596358 2001
Least of all stockbrokers, right?

179 598443 2585
It's all a fugazi.
You know what a fugazi is?

180 601112 2377
Fugayzi. It's a fake.

181 603615 2376
Fugayzi, fugazi,
it's a whazy, it's a woozy, it's...

182 606076 2334
Fairy dust. It doesn't exist.

183 608495 3419
It's never landed. It is no matter.
It's not on the elemental chart.

184 611998 2001
It's not fucking real.

185 614084 1834
- Right?
- Right.

186 616044 1667
Stay with me.

187 617837 2252
We don't create shit.
We don't build anything.

188 620215 1125
No.

189 621424 2836
So if you got a client
who bought stock at eight

190 624344 2418
and it now sits at 16,
he's all fucking happy.

191 626846 3086
He wants to cash in, liquidate,
take his fucking money and run home.

192 630016 1960
- You don't let him do that.
- Okay.

193 632102 1834
- 'Cause that would make it real.
- Right.

194 634020 1251
No. What do you do?

195 635355 1959
You get another brilliant idea.

196 637440 1417
A special idea.

197 638942 4587
Another "situation." Another stock
to reinvest his earnings and then some.

198 643613 2251
And he will, every single time.

199 645991 2042
'Cause they're fucking addicted.

200 648201 3002
And you just keep doing this,
again and again and again.

201 651288 2668
Meanwhile, he thinks
he's getting shit rich,

202 654040 2085
which he is, on paper.

203 656209 1667
But you and me, the brokers,

204 658003 4086
we're taking home cold hard cash
via commission, motherfucker.

205 662716 1166
Right.

206 665468 3086
That's incredible, sir.
I can't tell you how excited I am.

207 668722 1375
You should be.

208 670181 3753
There's two keys to success
in the broker business.

209 674060 1542
First of all...

210 677397 2251
- You gotta stay relaxed.
- Yeah.

211 679733 1125
Do you jerk off?

212 682402 1584
Do I... Do I jerk off?

213 684070 2210
Yeah. Yeah, I jerk off. Yeah.

214 686364 1292
How many times a week?

215 688742 1584
Like three or four.

216 690410 2293
- Three or four times, maybe five.
- Gotta pump those numbers up.

217 692787 2502
Those are rookie numbers
in this racket.

218 695415 3628
I myself, I jerk off at least twice a day.

219 699669 1167
- Wow.
- Once in the morning

220 700920 2460
right after I work out,
then once right after lunch.

221 703465 1375
Really?

222 705425 2418
I want to. That's not why I do it.

223 707969 2085
I do it 'cause I fucking need to.

224 711056 1583
Think about it.
You're dealing with numbers.

225 712724 2960
All day long, decimal points,
high frequencies.

226 715769 1041
Bang, bang, bang.

227 717771 1333
Fucking digits.

228 719856 2752
All very acidic
above-the-shoulders mustard shit.

229 722692 1250
All right?

230 724069 2459
It kind of wigs some people out. Right.

231 726613 2126
You got to feed the geese
to keep the blood flowing.

232 728823 1668
I keep the rhythm below the belt.

233 730617 1208
Done.

234 731910 1667
This is not a tip, this is a prescription.

235 733661 1167
Trust me.

236 734954 2460
If you don't, you will fall out of balance,

237 737499 2126
split your differential
and tip the fuck over.

238 739709 1292
Or worse yet,

239 741086 2209
I've seen this happen, implode.

240 743380 1458
No, I don't want to implode, sir.

241 744923 1167
No. No, you don't.

242 746174 1250
I'm in it for the long run, you know?

243 747509 1584
- Implosions are ugly.
- Yeah.

244 749177 2168
Pop off to the bathroom,
work one out any time you can.

245 751429 1000
When you get really good at it,

246 752514 3127
you'll fucking be stroking it
and you'll be thinking about money.

247 756309 4504
Second key to success in this racket

248 760897 1250
is this little baby right here.

249 762232 1375
It's called cocaine.

250 763691 1292
Right.

251 765068 3836
It'll keep you sharp between the ears.
It'll also help your fingers dial faster.

252 768988 1376
And guess what?

253 770448 1542
That's good for me.

254 772742 1250
Yes, sir.

255 774786 1459
Revolutions. You follow?

256 776329 1084
Revolutions.

257 777497 2251
Keep the clients on the Ferris wheel.

258 779833 3544
And it goes. The park is open 24/7, 365,

259 783461 2919
every decade, every goddamn century.

260 786506 1375
That's it.

261 788508 1167
The name of the game.

262 791219 1042
Halkidiki?

263 792345 1125
Thank you.

264 805859 1041
Come on.

265 812031 2001
We're the common denominator.

266 822625 1501
Keep it up for me.

267 824210 1918
You've seen the echo

268 826212 1542
And the money comes in

269 828339 1918
The parade comes to town

270 830383 1751
Going down Broadway

271 832218 1584
It's a one-way street

272 833887 1250
Whichever way I go

273 839267 1167
The next six months,

274 840518 2335
I got to know the ins
and outs of Wall Street.

275 842937 3628
Earning shit money as I geared up
to take my Series 7.

276 852405 1375
Oh, fuckers.

277 860747 3919
Then I was a licensed broker at last,

278 864751 1959
ready to make my fortune.

279 866794 4587
My first day as a future
Master of the Universe.

280 878264 2710
I have Exxon at 861/4 six months ago.

281 881100 2335
Today it is trading at 361/2.

282 883520 1166
Mr...

283 888608 2460
They called it Black Monday.

284 891152 1209
No shit.

285 892445 4087
By 4:00 p.m., the market
had dropped 508 points.

286 896616 2835
The biggest plummet
since the crash of '29.

287 899536 1375
I know your family, you know mine.

288 900995 3002
No, I don't know. Some fucking
country in Europe took a shit.

289 904082 1333
Let them do
what they want to fucking do.

290 905500 1250
Our market's solid.

291 906834 1626
This is not something
that you want to sell.

292 908586 1542
You know what happened?
A fucking tsunami.

293 910255 1250
I think you're making a big mistake.

294 911589 1417
Yes, I will talk to your wife.

295 913091 1083
Trust me, do not answer the phone.

296 914259 2960
A lot of people are gonna be calling you,
trying to get your dirty laundry.

297 917303 1292
We don't know what's going on here.

298 918680 1250
I know. I know.

299 930108 1250
Holy

300 933152 2127
fucking shit!

301 937115 1584
Unbelievable.

302 938783 2460
My first shitty day as a broker.

303 941327 2418
Within a month, L.F. Rothschild,

304 943830 4712
an institution since 1899,
closed its doors.

305 948918 2126
Wall Street had swallowed me up

306 951129 2376
and shit me right back out again.

307 956718 2459
We could pawn my engagement ring
if we needed to.

308 959262 1500
- Babe...
- Because I don't mind.

309 960847 1083
If we needed to, I'm saying...

310 962015 1542
- Will you listen to me?
- Okay.

311 963641 2126
You're not pawning anything. Okay?

312 965935 1292
- Okay.
- What do I always tell you?

313 967312 1125
You're gonna be a millionaire.

314 968521 2502
That's right. Okay? Just let me look.

315 971149 1041
We'll find something.

316 972609 1333
- How about this?
- What?

317 974027 2459
Nobody Beats the Wiz,
the electronics store.

318 976571 1459
Stock boy. What do you think?

319 978197 1167
You're not gonna work at that place.

320 979490 1000
Yeah, but, you know, you start off...

321 980575 1083
Jordan, you're gonna be
miserable at that place

322 981743 1041
- if you go there.
- I know.

323 982869 2209
It's sales. You work your way up,
you'll be a general manager.

324 985163 1792
- You're not gonna be a stock boy.
- Why not?

325 987040 1667
'Cause you're a stockbroker.

326 988791 2377
You understand that
nobody's hiring stockbrokers right now?

327 991252 1459
You understand that?

328 992837 1417
Okay?

329 999427 1584
This place is.

330 1001387 1417
- What?
- What's that say?

331 1002889 1208
"Stockbrokers."

332 1005850 1000
In Long Island?

333 1006934 1584
- Stockbrokers in Long Island?
- Yeah.

334 1008603 1709
It's in Long Island. So what?

335 1028498 3669
Hey, I'm looking for Investor's Center.

336 1033294 1793
What's that? You want to invest?

337 1035463 2793
No. Investor's Center.
I'm looking for Investor's Center.

338 1038341 3669
Yeah, yeah, that's us. Hey.
This is it. This is it.

339 1042095 1542
- I'm Dwayne. Yeah.
- You're Dwayne?

340 1043721 2001
Hi, Dwayne. We spoke on the phone.

341 1045848 1417
I'm Jordan Belfort.

342 1047350 2251
I'm the broker from
Rothschild in New York.

343 1049686 2084
Yes, yeah. Have a seat. How are you?

344 1051854 1125
We had a conversation...

345 1053064 1250
We spoke on the phone earlier, right?

346 1054399 1333
- Two hours ago.
- Right.

347 1055817 1000
Yeah.

348 1059445 1501
They're up and comers.
That's what that means.

349 1061072 1792
It's three cents a share, that's $3!

350 1062949 1459
You cheap fuck!

351 1064867 1501
So...

352 1066452 2961
So where are your Quotrons here?

353 1069539 1834
- Quotrons?
- Yeah. Your computers.

354 1071457 1292
No, no. We don't even
need computers here.

355 1072834 1709
We just trade right off
the pink sheets here.

356 1074711 1750
- Pink sheets?
- Yeah, they're penny stocks.

357 1076546 1834
You know, companies that
can't get listed on NASDAQ,

358 1078464 1167
they don't have enough capital?

359 1079799 1042
Their shares trade here.

360 1080925 1709
- Penny stocks?
- Yeah.

361 1082719 2876
This one, Aerodyne,
is a really interesting...

362 1085680 1375
Or Aerotyne...

363 1087140 1458
Aerotyne, yeah.

364 1088975 1333
Aero... Aerotyne...

365 1090518 1250
Aerotyne. Yeah.

366 1091853 1125
Very hot stock right now.

367 1093062 1000
Oh, yeah?

368 1094147 1250
They're just a couple
of brothers that are making

369 1095481 1292
radar detectors out of their garage.

370 1096858 1041
They're out in Dubuque.

371 1097984 1250
Maybe it's microwaves. I'm not sure.

372 1099318 1418
But you call the company's main line,

373 1100820 1792
their mom, Dorothy, answers
and she is so sweet.

374 1102697 1917
- Good company.
- I actually don't know what else to...

375 1104699 2585
I don't know anything else
about them other than that.

376 1107368 1542
Six cents a share?

377 1109704 2251
Hey, come on. Who buys this crap?

378 1112123 1042
Well, I mean...

379 1113458 1125
Honestly, mostly schmucks.

380 1114667 2001
Postmen, there's always postmen.

381 1116794 1876
Plumbers.

382 1118755 3043
They see our ads in the back
of Hustler and Popular Mechanics.

383 1121883 2835
Our ads actually say
they can get rich quick.

384 1124886 1125
- Hustler?
- Yeah.

385 1126095 1209
You know, those girlie magazines.

386 1127388 1459
Yeah, yeah. Nudie mag.

387 1128973 1083
- A lot.
- Yeah.

388 1130183 1584
We're helping them finance houses,

389 1131851 1918
we're helping them
buy their wife a diamond ring...

390 1133853 1042
A boat maybe.

391 1135021 2835
Is this... Is this stuff regulated
or are you guys...

392 1137940 1084
What are you doing here?

393 1141819 1084
Sort of.

394 1143154 1042
Sort of?

395 1146282 2168
Jesus Christ,
the spread on these is huge.

396 1148534 1251
Yeah. And that's the point, that's...

397 1149869 1083
What's your name again?

398 1151037 1333
Mine... Jordan Belfort.

399 1152538 1751
Jordan, what do you get
on that blue chip stock?

400 1154415 2960
I make one percent.
Or I did make one percent.

401 1157460 1834
Pink sheets, it's 50.

402 1162173 1375
It's 50%?

403 1164383 1376
50% commission?

404 1166052 1500
- Yup.
- For what?

405 1167887 1876
It's our markup for our services.

406 1171224 1333
And so if I... If I...

407 1172642 4044
If I sell a stock at $10,000,
my commission is 5,000 bucks?

408 1177146 2168
If you sell $10,000 worth of this stock,

409 1179398 2585
I will personally give you
a blowjob for free.

410 1183569 1876
And I hope it happens.

411 1187448 1626
Hello, John, how are you doing today?

412 1189242 2543
You mailed in my company
a postcard a few weeks back

413 1191869 3836
requesting information on penny stocks
that had huge upside potential

414 1195790 1667
with very little downside risk.

415 1197542 1917
- Does that ring a bell?
- Yeah, I may have sent something.

416 1199544 3127
Okay, great.
The reason for the call today, John, is,

417 1202755 2668
something just came
across my desk, John.

418 1205508 3002
It is perhaps the best thing
I've seen in the last six months.

419 1208594 2919
If you have 60 seconds, I'd like to share
the idea with you. You got a minute?

420 1211597 1000
Actually, I'm really very...

421 1212682 2459
The name of the company,
Aerotyne International.

422 1215226 3252
It is a cutting edge
high-tech firm out of the Midwest

423 1218729 1751
awaiting imminent patent approval

424 1220565 2543
on the next generation
of radar detectors

425 1223234 4378
that have both huge military
and civilian applications now.

426 1227697 1292
Right now, John,

427 1229115 2418
the stock trades over-the-counter
at 10 cents a share.

428 1231701 2293
And by the way, John,
our analysts indicate

429 1234078 2293
it could go a heck
of a lot higher than that.

430 1236455 5964
Your profit on a mere $6,000 investment
would be upwards of $60,000!

431 1242628 1417
Jesus! That's my mortgage, man.

432 1244130 1584
Exactly. You could
pay off your mortgage.

433 1245798 1501
This stock will pay off my house?

434 1247383 3085
John, one thing I can promise you,
even in this market,

435 1250636 3419
is that I never ask my clients
to judge me on my winners.

436 1254265 3461
I ask them to judge me on my losers
because I have so few.

437 1257852 1542
And in the case of Aerotyne,

438 1259478 2627
based on every technical factor
out there, John,

439 1262189 3128
we are looking at
a grand slam home run.

440 1265651 2627
Okay, let's do it. I'll do four grand.

441 1268362 2210
$4,000? That'd be 40,000 shares, John.

442 1270740 1375
Let me lock in that trade right now

443 1272199 1292
and get back to you with my secretary

444 1273576 1917
with an exact confirmation.
Sound good, John?

445 1275578 1250
- Yeah, sounds good.
- Great.

446 1276913 1166
Hey, John.

447 1278164 2042
Thank you for your vote of confidence.

448 1280291 1417
And welcome to the Investor's Center.

449 1281792 1126
Yeah, thanks a lot, man.

450 1283044 1250
Bye-bye.

451 1287673 1668
How'd you fucking do that?

452 1291802 2293
Just like that, I made two grand.

453 1294180 2752
The other guys looked at me
like I'd just discovered fire.

454 1298517 1251
Great! Even better!

455 1299894 3627
I was selling garbage to garbage men
and making cash hand over fist.

456 1303856 2293
The only problem you're gonna have
is that you didn't buy more.

457 1308235 1626
So I was selling them shit.

458 1310279 3419
But the way I looked at it,
their money was better off in my pocket.

459 1313783 1834
I knew how to spend it better.

460 1316077 2293
Excuse me. Is that your car in the lot?

461 1318704 1167
Yeah.

462 1320414 1501
- It's a nice ride.
- Thanks, man.

463 1322124 1084
Donnie Azoff.

464 1323334 1000
Hey. I'm Jordan Belfort.

465 1324418 1292
- Nice to meet you.
- How you doing?

466 1325795 1834
You know, actually,
I see that car around.

467 1327713 1668
- I see it around a lot.
- Oh, yeah, where?

468 1329465 1792
I think we live in the same building.

469 1331342 1083
- No shit?
- Yeah, yeah.

470 1332510 1709
- Twelfth floor?
- Yeah. What floor are you on?

471 1334345 1083
Fourth floor.

472 1335513 1834
- I have two little kids. Ugly wife.
- Right.

473 1339308 1084
What do you do, bro?

474 1341727 1626
What do you mean, what do I do?

475 1343479 1167
For work, what do you do?

476 1344730 1167
I'm a stockbroker.

477 1346065 1667
- Stockbroker?
- Yeah.

478 1348234 1167
Children's furniture.

479 1349735 1042
Oh, good for you.

480 1350861 1376
It's all right.

481 1352530 1250
You make a lot of money?

482 1355324 1584
Yeah, I do all right for myself.

483 1357076 1167
I'm trying to put it together.

484 1358369 2918
You got your fucking nice car,
we live in the same building. I just...

485 1361372 2585
I'm not understanding...
How much money do you make?

486 1365751 2085
I don't know. $70,000 last month.

487 1368254 1459
Get the fuck...

488 1370006 1583
Get the fuck out of here.

489 1371757 1167
No, I'm serious.

490 1373092 1167
Yeah, no, I'm serious, too.

491 1374510 1876
Seriously, how much money
do you make?

492 1376679 2084
I told you. $70,000.

493 1378973 2418
Well, technically, $72,000.

494 1381600 1835
Last month. Something like that.

495 1384437 2084
You made 72 grand in one month?

496 1386605 1167
Yeah.

497 1392236 1209
I'll tell you what.

498 1394488 2210
You show me a pay stub
for $72,000 on it,

499 1396782 2335
I quit my job right now
and I work for you.

500 1406292 1167
Hey, Paulie, what's up?

501 1408586 1292
No, yeah, yeah. No, everything's fine.

502 1410004 1375
Hey, listen, I quit.

503 1411630 1709
And he did quit his job.

504 1413466 2918
Which I thought was a little weird.
I mean, I just met this fucking guy.

505 1416677 1667
Don't fucking tell Susan.
It's none of her business.

506 1418471 1292
There were other things about him, too.

507 1419847 2126
Like his phosphorescent white teeth.

508 1422058 1166
...wife! I gotta fucking
deal with your wife?

509 1423309 2168
The fact that he wore
horn rims with clear lenses

510 1425561 1959
just to look more WASP-y.

511 1427605 2877
And then, there were these rumors.

512 1431025 2168
I heard some stupid shit. I don't know.

513 1433277 2460
Fuck, I didn't even want
to bring it up. It's just...

514 1435821 1793
- It's stupid.
- Shit with me?

515 1437740 2126
You know, people say shit.
I don't even know.

516 1439950 2418
I don't even listen to it half the time.

517 1442912 1125
What are they saying?

518 1444830 2752
Shit about you and your cousin
or something like that.

519 1447666 1209
I don't even listen to it.

520 1448959 2544
Bro, it's not like that.

521 1451629 1417
It's not like that.

522 1453130 2710
Like you married your cousin
or some stupid shit. No?

523 1456884 1042
Yeah, my wife. Yeah.

524 1458010 1751
My wife is my cousin, or whatever.

525 1459845 2627
But it's not like what you think,
or whatever, you know.

526 1462556 1960
Is she like a first cousin, or is she...

527 1464683 1167
Yeah, no, she's, you know...

528 1466018 1876
Her... Her father

529 1468521 2126
is the brother of my mom.

530 1471273 1084
It's not like, what... You know.

531 1472483 1500
Look, we grew up together.

532 1474068 2376
And she grew up hot, you know.
She fucking grew up hot.

533 1476529 1750
And all my friends were
trying to fuck her, you know.

534 1478364 1876
And I'm not gonna let someone...

535 1480366 1542
You know, one of these assholes
fuck my cousin,

536 1481992 3461
so, you know, I used the cousin thing
as like an in with her.

537 1485579 2460
I'm not gonna let
someone else fuck my cousin.

538 1488124 1667
You know, if anyone's
gonna fuck my cousin,

539 1489875 1876
it's gonna be me,
out of respect. You know?

540 1491836 1125
No, I get it. Yeah.

541 1493045 2168
I mean, you're not afraid of like
the whole kid thing, right?

542 1495339 1167
- What? Having kids with her?
- Yeah.

543 1496590 1209
No. We have two kids.

544 1498050 1292
And they're... I mean...

545 1499426 2585
I don't want to get personal,
but they're okay?

546 1502096 2126
No, they're not retarded
or anything like that.

547 1504390 1834
But there's a big chance, right, if...

548 1506308 2335
Yeah, there's like a 60%, you know,

549 1508727 3503
60 to 65% chance the kid's
gonna be fucking retarded or whatever.

550 1512314 1084
That'd scare the shit out of me, buddy.

551 1513524 2293
Look, man, a lot of having a kid,
or whatever, takes risk,

552 1515901 1751
whether you're fucking cousins or not.

553 1517736 2752
What if something like that happened?

554 1520573 1584
Basically, you know,
if the kid was retarded,

555 1522241 3294
I would, you know,
drive it up to the country

556 1525619 1668
and just, like, you know,
open the door and say,

557 1527413 2168
"You're free now."
You know, like, "Run free."

558 1530082 1084
You know?

559 1535838 2084
You're completely fucking with me.

560 1540217 1709
That's horrible. You're not gonna...

561 1542011 1584
You look like you've... No.

562 1543679 1834
We would take it to, like,
an institution or somewhere

563 1545598 2793
that's handled to, like, you know,
raise the kid or whatever.

564 1548851 2168
You know what? If you're happy,
God bless you, buddy.

565 1551103 3336
No, I'm not fucking happy.
No one who's married is fucking happy.

566 1554607 1667
Well, I'm sorry to hear that, buddy.

567 1556442 1917
Listen, I'm really, you know...

568 1558444 2334
I'm really appreciative
for this fucking job.

569 1560946 1084
I'm really enjoying it.

570 1562114 1417
I'm really happy with what you're doing.

571 1563616 2293
Actually, I got you a little present.

572 1566035 1375
- You got me a present?
- I got you something.

573 1567494 1292
Oh, fuck. You're sweet.

574 1568913 1208
Yeah. It's in the back though.

575 1570915 1667
- What do you mean?
- You gotta go out back.

576 1573125 1834
Like it's wrapped up or something?

577 1575085 1459
It's wrapped up. Yeah.

578 1576629 1125
- I don't get it.
- Neither do I.

579 1577838 1459
Let's fucking go. Come on.

580 1580549 1000
Your turn.

581 1581634 2084
I'm not fucking doing this.
You're out of your fucking mind.

582 1583844 1918
- Smoke this shit, bro.
- No.

583 1585846 2001
No one's fucking here, bro.

584 1587932 1041
Get the fuck...

585 1589058 1792
Fucking smoke crack with me, bro.

586 1590935 1125
I'm not fucking doing it.

587 1592144 2710
Smoke crack. Smoke some
fucking crack with me, bro.

588 1594939 2376
- One hit. One hit. That's it.
- Okay.

589 1597650 1667
Fucking nut job.

590 1621507 1542
Wow!

591 1625594 1250
Wow.

592 1630516 1333
Let's go run, huh?

593 1632268 1792
We gotta get out of here, buddy.

594 1634478 2460
We gotta get out of here.
Let's go fucking run.

595 1637022 3419
Let's run like we're fucking lions
and tigers and bears!

596 1640693 2334
Let's run! Let's fucking run!

597 1643404 1709
Let's fucking run! Go!

598 1645239 1333
Go, go, go, go!

599 1648033 2001
You've reached Frank's Best Auto Body.

600 1650119 1500
We're closed right now.

601 1651704 2001
So please leave us a message.

602 1653789 1667
Hello. My name is Jordan Belfort.

603 1655541 3419
My partner and I are very interested
in renting out your garage.

604 1659044 2460
Donnie and I were
going out on our own.

605 1661588 2335
And the first thing
we needed was brokers.

606 1664008 1917
Guys with sales experience.

607 1666010 1917
So I recruited
some of my hometown boys.

608 1668012 3168
Sea Otter, who sold meat and weed.

609 1671265 3377
Chester, who sold tires and weed.

610 1674727 2835
And Robbie, who sold anything
he could get his hands on.

611 1677771 1167
Mostly weed.

612 1679565 2001
Can you bring me some ketchup? Okay?

613 1681984 1083
This is Brad.

614 1683152 1667
And Brad's the guy I really wanted.

615 1684903 1251
But he didn't go along with us.

616 1686238 2543
He was already making
so much money selling Quaaludes,

617 1688866 2751
he'd become the Quaalude king
of Bayside.

618 1691744 1041
Getting any pussy
with that thing or what?

619 1692870 958
Yeah, man, of course.

620 1693912 1918
Bring some of them chicks
around here sometime, huh?

621 1695914 1251
Let 'em watch.

622 1697249 1834
Let 'em watch. Know what I mean?

623 1699585 3586
Hey, Zip! You tell your sister
I was asking about her.

624 1703589 2835
Why don't you bring me a pair of
her panties next time you come through.

625 1706759 2585
Yeah, man. She said she don't want
to talk to you anymore, man.

626 1709595 1041
Get the fuck out of here.

627 1712056 1875
Hey, Ma, we got chicken or what?

628 1714892 1083
Ma!

629 1716643 2001
You listening? It's easier than you think.

630 1718771 1417
Every person you're on the phone with,

631 1720272 2502
they want to get rich
and they want to get rich quickly.

632 1722858 1167
They all want something for nothing.

633 1724109 2460
There was this one time that
I was selling pot to this Amish dude.

634 1726653 1376
You know those guys
who got like the beard

635 1728113 2043
with like no mustache or some bullshit?

636 1730741 3377
Well, he says that he only
wants to make furniture.

637 1734745 958
I don't understand.

638 1735788 1166
What's that got to do with anything?

639 1737122 1793
What the fuck are you talking about?

640 1739249 1626
I'm not putting words
in your mouth or nothing,

641 1740959 3169
but you just said that
everybody wants to get rich.

642 1744296 2335
Holy fuck, you did just say that.

643 1747299 1751
What the fuck are you talking about?

644 1749134 2085
Yeah, like Buddhists.
They don't give a shit about money.

645 1751303 2001
They're wrapped in sheets.
They're not buying shit.

646 1753389 1750
I'm not talking about
Buddhists or Amish.

647 1755224 2751
I'm talking about normal people,
working-class, everyday people.

648 1758060 1917
Everyone wants to get rich. Am I crazy?

649 1760062 1292
There's no such thing
as an Amish Buddhist.

650 1761438 1876
- I'm pretty fucking sure.
- There could be.

651 1764191 1459
Can we get some ketchup, please?

652 1765734 1376
Do you guys not want to make money?

653 1767194 1751
I want to make some money.

654 1769029 1292
I want to make
some fucking money, okay.

655 1770406 1333
I can sell anything.

656 1771824 1917
Shit, I can sell ludes
to a convent full of nuns,

657 1773826 1917
and get them so horny
they'd be fucking each other.

658 1775828 1834
That's the attitude.
You can sell anything?

659 1777746 1584
Sell me this fucking pen right here.

660 1779415 1667
You can sell anything.
Sell that. Go ahead.

661 1781166 1167
Sell me the pen.

662 1783127 2001
Can I finish eating first?
I haven't eaten today.

663 1785295 2293
Brad, show them how it's done. Boom.

664 1787714 1459
Sell me that pen. Watch. Go on.

665 1789341 1459
You want me to sell this fucking pen?

666 1790884 2502
That's my boy right there.
Can fucking sell anything.

667 1793470 1000
Why don't you do me a favor.

668 1794555 1667
Write your name down
on that napkin for me.

669 1796306 1042
I don't have a pen.

670 1797433 1709
Exactly. Supply and demand, my friend.

671 1799226 1083
- Holy shit.
- See what I'm saying?

672 1800394 1375
He's creating urgency.

673 1801937 1375
Get them to want to buy the stock.

674 1803397 1876
Convince them it's something
they need, you know what I mean?

675 1805357 1167
And that's the thing.

676 1806608 1501
All nuns are lesbians.

677 1808360 1751
What the fuck
are you talking about, Otter?

678 1810195 2794
Think about it. They can't keep a dude
so they're gonna start fucking chicks.

679 1813073 2126
Four fucking times, Kimmie! Four times.

680 1815367 1375
- He's not with us.
- Friggin' Rambo.

681 1816827 1334
Now she runs.

682 1818287 2835
But look. I knew these guys
weren't like Harvard MBAs.

683 1821206 3920
Robbie Feinberg, the pinhead,
took five years to finish high school.

684 1825210 2919
Alden Kupferberg, the Sea Otter,
didn't even graduate.

685 1828380 4087
Chester Ming, the depraved Chinaman,
thought jujitsu was in Israel.

686 1832676 2335
Smartest of the bunch
was Nicky Koskoff.

687 1835095 1667
He actually went to law school.

688 1836847 3419
I called him Rugrat
because of his piece of shit hairpiece.

689 1841059 3128
Still, give them to me
young, hungry and stupid

690 1844271 3044
and in no time, I'll make them rich.

691 1849443 1125
Oh, my God.

692 1851028 1083
Jordan, that...

693 1852404 1125
You like it, baby?

694 1853614 1750
Oh, my God, it's beautiful.

695 1856074 1793
They're not the biggest stones
in the world,

696 1857951 1751
but I promise they're really high quality.

697 1859786 1376
It's beautiful.

698 1861538 1626
They're so beautiful.

699 1863749 1000
Oh, boy.

700 1865250 1000
What?

701 1866335 2501
I know that look. What is it? Go ahead.

702 1868921 1667
I don't know, it's... You know...

703 1871173 2293
These stocks... These companies...

704 1874009 1584
They're like crappy companies.

705 1875719 1250
- Well, yeah.
- Okay.

706 1877095 1334
Yeah, they're terrible.

707 1879306 2668
Don't worry about it. I told you,
what I'm doing is completely legal.

708 1882100 1042
Yeah, I know.

709 1883227 2126
But they're not gonna make
anyone money though, right?

710 1886230 2001
Well, sometimes they do,
sometimes they don't.

711 1888315 1417
You know how it goes.

712 1889942 2418
Wouldn't you feel better
if you sold that stuff to rich people

713 1892444 2960
who can, like, afford
to lose all that money?

714 1896615 1000
Of course.

715 1898784 2042
But rich people don't buy penny stocks.

716 1901453 1334
They just don't.

717 1903163 1292
Why not?

718 1906458 3169
Because they're too smart,
that's why not.

719 1909795 2918
I mean, what person
with a college education

720 1912798 1292
would trust this bunch of jerk-offs?

721 1914174 1209
Hang up the phone.
Tell him you'll call him back.

722 1915467 1084
I got five fucking grand
on the phone right now!

723 1916635 1042
Hey!

724 1917761 2960
But what if they didn't sound
like a bunch of jerk-offs?

725 1920847 3211
What if I could teach them
how to sell to people with money?

726 1924268 1375
Real money.

727 1926311 1584
So I decided to reinvent the company.

728 1928480 2126
Gentlemen, welcome

729 1931358 2126
to Stratton Oakmont.

730 1933819 4837
You schnooks will now be targeting
the wealthiest 1% of Americans.

731 1938949 1834
We're talking about whales here.

732 1940993 1750
Moby fucking Dicks.

733 1942869 4170
And with this script,
which is now your new harpoon,

734 1947124 2084
I'm gonna teach
each and every one of you

735 1949334 2627
to be Captain fucking Ahab.

736 1952254 1417
Get it? Huh?

737 1953839 1292
Captain who?

738 1955215 1417
Captain Ahab. From the fucking...

739 1958427 1876
The book, motherfucker. From the book.

740 1960387 2001
Turn your fucking brain on.

741 1962472 1501
- Fuck you.
- Jesus fuck, Robbie.

742 1964057 2835
Listen to me.
We're a new company with a new name.

743 1966977 3169
A company that
our clients can believe in.

744 1970355 2794
A company that our clients can trust.

745 1973233 4545
A firm whose roots are
so deeply embedded into Wall Street

746 1977863 3419
that our very founders
sailed over on the Mayflower

747 1981366 1834
and chiseled the name
Stratton Oakmont

748 1983285 2293
right into Plymouth fucking Rock!

749 1985829 1125
You got it?

750 1987497 1709
What we're gonna do is this.

751 1989291 5171
First we pitch 'em Disney, AT&T, IBM,
blue chip stocks exclusively.

752 1994546 2168
Companies these people know.

753 1996965 3878
Once we've suckered them in,
we unload the dog shit.

754 2000969 3670
The pink sheets, the penny stocks,
where we make the money.

755 2004890 2001
50% commission, baby.

756 2007225 2752
Now the key to making money
in a situation like this

757 2010062 3002
is to position yourself now
before the settlement.

758 2013273 2794
Because by the time you read about it
in The Wall Street Journal,

759 2016151 1876
it's already too late.

760 2018779 1458
Then you wait.

761 2020322 1083
You wait.

762 2021490 2585
And whoever speaks first loses.

763 2026119 1209
Sorry...

764 2027496 1417
I appreciate the call.

765 2029081 4128
I really have to give this some thought
and talk to my wife about it.

766 2033293 1334
Can I call you back?

767 2034711 1292
They don't know, right?
They gotta think about it,

768 2036088 2376
they gotta talk to their fucking wives,
or the fucking Tooth Fairy.

769 2038548 1793
Point is, it doesn't matter
what the fuck they say.

770 2040425 3503
The only real objection that they have
is that they don't trust you guys.

771 2044012 1626
And why should they trust you?
I mean, look at you.

772 2045764 1709
You're a bunch of fucking
sleazy salesmen, right?

773 2048767 1500
So, what do you say?

774 2050352 3169
You mean to tell me that if I put you in
at Union Carbide at seven

775 2053605 1417
and took you out at 32...

776 2055107 2585
Texas Instruments at 11
and took you out at 47...

777 2057776 2460
U.S. Steel at 16, took you out at 41...

778 2060320 1667
You wouldn't be saying
to me right now, "Chester,

779 2062114 1750
"pick me up
a few thousand shares of Disney

780 2063949 2126
"on the spot, right now. Come on."

781 2066159 1334
Honestly, Kevin? Honestly? Seriously?

782 2067577 1334
I don't know you.

783 2068995 2293
You cold-called me.
You're a total stranger.

784 2071456 2752
I am in complete agreement with you.
You don't know me, I don't know you.

785 2074376 2543
Let me introduce myself to you.
My name is Alden Kupferberg.

786 2077003 1334
- Robbie Feinberg.
- Chester Ming.

787 2078463 1793
I'm Senior Vice President
at Stratton Oakmont...

788 2080340 1417
...and I plan on being one of the...

789 2081842 2293
...top brokers in my firm next year.

790 2084219 1918
And I'm not gonna get there
by being wrong, Stanley.

791 2086304 1918
I do wanna say that you sound like a...

792 2088306 1751
You sound like a pretty sincere guy.

793 2090142 2251
It's not gonna make you rich
and it's not gonna make you poor.

794 2092477 2460
But what this trade will do is serve as...

795 2095021 2252
...a benchmark for
future business, Kevin.

796 2097399 1792
You feel comfortable
with me now, Scotty?

797 2099317 1251
And then you'll know for sure

798 2100652 2043
that you finally found
a broker on Wall Street

799 2102779 1542
that you can trust,

800 2104406 3586
and who can consistently
make you money.

801 2108160 1333
Sound fair enough?

802 2111663 1834
You know what... Yeah.

803 2114374 2085
I gotta say, I'm pretty impressed.

804 2118003 1292
What are you thinking?

805 2119379 1084
Kevin.

806 2121047 1876
You give me one shot here

807 2123008 2626
on a blue chip stock like Kodak,

808 2125719 2209
and believe me, Kevin,

809 2128013 2501
the only problem you're gonna have

810 2130599 2418
is that you didn't buy more.

811 2133185 1500
Sound fair enough?

812 2136188 1041
Shit. My...

813 2141151 1626
My wife might divorce me, but...

814 2142903 1125
Yeah, let's do it.

815 2145697 1417
Excellent choice, Kevin.

816 2147199 1834
How much do you
want to go for this time?

817 2149201 1875
Let's do five... $5,000.

818 2151161 1167
Can we try 8,000, Kevin?

819 2152412 1334
All right. Let's do 10.

820 2154039 1083
- Ten.
- You want to do that?

821 2155207 1000
Excellent choice!

822 2156291 2793
Kevin, let me lock in that trade right now
and get back to you in a few minutes

823 2159169 1292
with an exact confirmation, Kevin.

824 2160545 2585
And welcome to Stratton Oakmont.

825 2163215 2167
Thanks, man. I'm gonna have a beer.

826 2165550 1042
This is fun.

827 2166676 1209
Take it easy, Kev.

828 2168053 1834
Hey, thanks, Jordan. Thanks a...

829 2170639 1917
Fuck that motherfucker!

830 2172766 1751
That's what I'm talking about!

831 2177979 1292
What a fucking idiot.

832 2179523 3294
The one thing I know about
in this world is airlines.

833 2183151 3127
And Cuchon Airlines
is the future of airlines.

834 2186404 1084
Get in now or...

835 2187697 1626
- I'm Nicky Koskoff...
- Chester Ming...

836 2189407 2502
...and I'm a Senior Vice President
with Stratton Oakmont.

837 2192661 3460
Judy, I am so, so, so sorry for your loss.

838 2196581 1084
When did he pass?

839 2197749 1000
Just say I'm wrong, right.

840 2198834 1041
And the stock goes down
a couple points...

841 2199960 1500
...and it makes you,
in the words of my grandfather,

842 2201545 2793
God rest his soul, "A shit ton of money."

843 2204422 1126
It's like getting in on fucking sunlight

844 2205632 1626
before there was fucking sunlight.
You understand?

845 2207425 1668
Can we do 8,000 shares?

846 2209177 1459
Okay, 25,000.

847 2212514 1250
That's a very intelligent decision.

848 2213849 1625
I'm gonna transfer you
to my sales associate.

849 2216393 1041
Rhonda!

850 2218144 1292
- Rhonda!
...put you through to Andrea.

851 2219521 1625
Has anybody fucking seen Rhonda?

852 2227696 1333
Everybody have a good week?

853 2229114 1041
Yeah!

854 2231533 1125
The end of the month.

855 2232784 3377
$28.7 million in gross commissions,

856 2236246 3294
all from pink sheet stock, boys!

857 2240876 3002
And to celebrate with
our weekly act of debauchery,

858 2243962 1751
I have offered
our lovely sales assistant,

859 2245797 1918
Danielle Harrison, here,

860 2247799 3753
$10,000 to shave her fucking head!

861 2252220 1125
Yeah!

862 2254681 1626
Yeah, you want this?

863 2256474 1000
You want this?

864 2257642 2335
Let's scalp her! Scalp her!

865 2260186 2210
Let the scalping begin!

866 2266151 1292
Scalp! Scalp! Scalp!

867 2269404 5254
FYI, boys, Danielle has promised
to use this $10,000 for breast implants!

868 2274743 3419
She's already got C cups,
but now she wants fucking double D's!

869 2278330 2668
Is this a great fucking
company or what?

870 2283335 2876
Is this the greatest company
in the world?

871 2289341 1292
Donnie!

872 2290800 3378
Blow the roof off this motherfucker!

873 2322999 1417
Champagne?

874 2328380 2418
Send in the stripees!

875 2365208 1042
Mine!

876 2381307 3628
Word about us spread
throughout Wall Street.

877 2385020 2292
Even the places I didn't want it to.

878 2396531 2460
It wasn't long before Forbes magazine,

879 2399075 2794
the flagship of Wall Street,
called to do a profile on me.

880 2401953 3294
Let me ask you, how do you see
the future for Stratton Oakmont?

881 2405331 1167
One word?

882 2408835 1876
Diversification.

883 2410795 1292
Sounds good. Thank you so much.
I have more than enough.

884 2412172 1000
- I appreciate your time.
- Fantastic.

885 2413256 1000
Can we get a quick picture?

886 2415800 3044
A total fucking hatchet job.

887 2418928 2168
This conniving little twat! Look at this!

888 2421598 2751
"The Wolf of Wall Street"
they call me. Look.

889 2424434 958
Your hair looks good.

890 2425477 1417
- Well, my hair looks good.
- Yeah.

891 2428104 3002
"Jordan Belfort, sounding like
a kind of twisted Robin Hood

892 2431191 2626
"who takes from the rich
and gives to himself

893 2433943 1751
"and his merry little band of brokers."

894 2435779 1834
- Read that. Read it.
- Listen.

895 2437697 3378
There is no such thing
as bad publicity, sweetheart.

896 2441159 1500
Read the article, babe.

897 2442827 2377
Jordan, you look great!
You're in a huge magazine.

898 2445330 1542
Big fucking deal I look great.

899 2448124 1376
Mr. Belfort! Can you
look at my resume, please?

900 2449584 1918
Excuse me, excuse me, sir!

901 2453880 1500
Calm the fuck down!

902 2455965 1292
What the hell's all this?

903 2457467 2710
It's the Forbes article.
They all want to work for you now.

904 2460345 1083
Hey! What did I say?

905 2461513 1166
I'm just trying to be nice.

906 2463014 2585
Hey, you want a job, you talk to me!

907 2465975 1000
- Mr. Belfort!
- Give me one minute.

908 2467143 2543
Forbes made me a superstar.

909 2470897 4837
Every day, dozens of money-crazed
kids beat a path to my door.

910 2476611 3127
If we hired 'em, they dropped
straight out of college overnight

911 2479823 4128
and spent whatever allowance they had
on a new suit from our Stratton tailor.

912 2484035 1542
Are you fucking serious right now?

913 2486079 3669
I mean, we were literally
putting clothes on these kids' backs.

914 2489874 2961
And here comes this jerk-off
sniffing around.

915 2493044 3044
But, you know, every time
someone rises up in this world,

916 2496172 3378
there's always gonna be
some asshole trying to drag him down.

917 2500927 3961
Within months, we doubled in size,
moved to even bigger offices.

918 2512313 1251
It was a madhouse.

919 2514065 1167
A greed-fest,

920 2515316 3920
with equal parts cocaine,
testosterone, and body fluids.

921 2519654 1125
Yes!

922 2521656 3753
It got so bad, I had to declare
the office a fuck-free zone

923 2525493 1918
between the hours of 9:00 and 7:00.

924 2527495 2669
But I'm telling you, even that didn't help.

925 2530248 3044
Actually, the madness started
on our very first day,

926 2533376 1459
when one of our brokers, Ben Jenner,

927 2534919 2126
christened the elevator
by getting a blowjob

928 2537130 1542
from a sales assistant.

929 2538756 1876
Her name was Pam, and to her credit,

930 2540717 5045
she did have this amazing technique,
with this wild twist and jerk motion.

931 2545930 1334
About a month later,

932 2547348 1918
Donnie and I decided
to double-team her

933 2549350 1167
on a Saturday afternoon

934 2550602 2751
while our wives were out
shopping for Christmas dresses.

935 2553730 1292
Eventually, Ben married her,

936 2555106 2460
which was pretty amazing
considering she blew

937 2557650 2293
every single guy in the office.

938 2560195 3085
Then he got depressed
and killed himself three years later.

939 2563531 4295
Anyway, I hired my dad, Max,
to maintain order as the Enforcer.

940 2567911 1667
Stratton's very own Gestapo.

941 2571456 3002
We called him Mad Max
because of his hair-trigger temper,

942 2574542 3920
which could be set off by something
as innocuous as a ringing telephone.

943 2579631 2626
Who the fuck has the goddamn gall

944 2582342 2626
to call this house on a Tuesday night?

945 2585220 2001
God damn it!

946 2587305 1042
You're gonna miss it!

947 2588431 1834
Please, tell me something I don't know.

948 2590350 2751
I wait all week for the fucking Equalizer

949 2593186 2293
and they have to fucking... Hello.

950 2595563 1709
But as soon as
he picked up the phone...

951 2597357 1292
Gene. How are you, Gene?

952 2598775 1917
...he'd affect this weird British accent.

953 2600777 2209
Right-o, Gene, that'd be great.

954 2603112 1167
Cheerio.

955 2604364 1041
It was absolutely bizarre.

956 2605490 1542
The fucking halfwit!

957 2607116 1042
- He'd hang up...
- You missed it!

958 2608243 2251
...and then he's Mad Max all over again.

959 2610620 1000
Damn it!

960 2611746 2168
All right, tell me what happened.
What happened?

961 2614082 2042
Well, he discovered
it was the mother's sister.

962 2616209 1417
Who's he? Who? Tell me who...

963 2617710 1584
The main guy.
You know who the main...

964 2619379 1083
The main guy...

965 2620546 2335
It was his mother's sister.
She showed up dead.

966 2624342 1584
Of course, Mad Max didn't have to know

967 2626010 1668
everything we were doing at Stratton.

968 2627887 1918
And then there's a big target and we...

969 2630014 1834
They get launched at the target.
They stick.

970 2631975 2084
There's a bull's-eye and
the bull's-eye's a dollar sign.

971 2634143 1084
Whoever gets closer to the dollar sign

972 2635311 959
gets the most points.

973 2636354 2209
I'm gonna throw the shit out
of this little fucking thing.

974 2638648 1917
So if it gets hurt, what happens?

975 2640650 1292
'Cause we're gonna get fucking nuts.

976 2642026 1251
I don't think he's gonna get hurt.
They're like...

977 2643361 1751
They got like superhuman strength.

978 2645196 1209
I think he's gonna be fine.

979 2646489 1959
You can't look him right in the eyes.

980 2648533 1125
You can't look him in the eye?

981 2649742 1668
That's a fact. I saw it on PBS.

982 2651577 1793
They get confused
and their wires get crossed.

983 2653454 1543
You gotta look at their chin.

984 2655081 1042
Like it looks like I'm looking at you

985 2656207 1000
but I'm looking at your chin.

986 2657292 2167
I feel like you're addressing me
right now, but you're not, are you?

987 2659544 1876
They're like the Mona Lisa.
They find eye contact,

988 2661504 1542
like, wherever you are
standing in the room.

989 2663214 1125
And they lock in.

990 2664549 2501
No, but there is a limit
to what we can do with them?

991 2667135 1125
We're allowed to throw shit at 'em.

992 2668386 1375
We're allowed to throw food? Bananas.

993 2669887 1418
Any food. Correct.

994 2671389 1042
But, for example, what I wouldn't do is

995 2672515 1751
maybe like tell him to pull his cock out

996 2674350 1709
and like get some
of the girls to, you know,

997 2676185 1042
fondle him and shit like that.

998 2677312 1000
That would be... That's unacceptable?

999 2678396 1000
Let's keep that in our back pocket.

1000 2679480 2001
This guy is more about
throwing at the dartboard.

1001 2681566 1000
Correct. Yes, yes, yes.

1002 2682692 1334
The thing is, this is their gift, okay.

1003 2684110 2043
They're built to be thrown
like a lawn dart.

1004 2686237 1209
They're top heavy like a lawn dart.

1005 2687530 1000
So they're built for accuracy.

1006 2688614 1960
Oh, my God. Can we bowl with this guy?

1007 2690742 1000
That's his fucking brother, Rob.

1008 2691826 1334
His brother's the bowling ball.

1009 2693244 1709
The brother, you put
a skateboard on him,

1010 2695038 1292
you strap him to a skateboard,

1011 2696414 1375
you toss him down
an alley at some pins.

1012 2697874 1625
- No shit. That's interesting.
- Swear to fucking God.

1013 2699584 2001
- Can we get that guy?
- Yeah, we'll get that guy, too.

1014 2701669 2085
But it says here this guy
will show his cock. Yeah.

1015 2703838 1250
- Instead of growing up. Yeah.
- He will?

1016 2705173 1292
They are very ornery by the way,

1017 2706549 1375
so you gotta be very careful
with these little guys.

1018 2708009 1042
Safety first.

1019 2709135 1083
Safety is first, all right?

1020 2710303 1876
I want somebody with
a fucking tranquilizer gun

1021 2712263 1626
ready to knock this fucker out.

1022 2713973 2168
- Do we want to get like a...
- Mace. Taser guns.

1023 2716225 1000
A pellet gun maybe?

1024 2717310 1125
No, a pellet gun is gonna hurt him.

1025 2718519 1334
I just want him out. Knocked out cold.

1026 2720021 2501
But I say we stick with the loophole.
Right? Okay?

1027 2722774 1750
If we don't consider him a human,

1028 2724609 2126
we just consider it an act,
I think we're in the clear.

1029 2726819 1042
Like The Flying Wallendas.

1030 2727945 1960
You know, a lot of those guys died
but they never sued anybody.

1031 2729989 1751
The important thing
you guys gotta keep in mind

1032 2731824 1834
is that these things gossip.

1033 2733785 1584
They get together and they gossip.

1034 2735453 1375
- That's a good point.
- And the last thing

1035 2736913 2168
that we need is them
getting together and saying,

1036 2739165 1584
"Oh, they made fun of us."

1037 2740833 1584
Like, it's gonna make Stratton look bad.

1038 2742502 2084
That's why I love you.
You think of shit like that.

1039 2744670 3002
When they come in,
we treat it just like one of us. Okay?

1040 2747924 3127
One of us. Gooble gobble, one of us.

1041 2751177 1542
We accept them, one of us!

1042 2752887 1626
Gooble gobble, one of us.

1043 2754639 1292
We accept them, one of us.

1044 2756015 1042
Gooble gobble, one of us!

1045 2757141 1292
Jordan! Your dad's coming.

1046 2758518 1458
Something about
the American Express bill.

1047 2760144 1084
Can you get him out of here?

1048 2761354 1125
Yeah. Lick my twat.

1049 2762647 1167
No, I'm serious!

1050 2764524 1709
Fuck. Guys, act like we're working.

1051 2766317 1459
You got any fucking stock forms?

1052 2768236 1167
He's coming, he's coming.

1053 2769487 1167
Make some shit up.

1054 2771197 1542
I think if we short Pfizer...

1055 2773199 4545
$430,000 in one month, Jordy, huh?

1056 2777995 5171
Four hundred and fucking 30,000
fucking dollars in one fucking month!

1057 2783251 2168
Good morning.
They're business expenses. Relax.

1058 2785503 1208
- Business expenses?
- Yes.

1059 2786796 1417
- Jordy, look what you got here.
- What?

1060 2788297 3878
Look at this. $26,000
for one fucking dinner!

1061 2792343 1626
Okay. No, no. This could be explained.

1062 2794262 2209
Dad, we had clients. The Pfizer clients.

1063 2796764 1668
Right. The porterhouse from Argentina.

1064 2798516 2251
Expensive champagne and...
We had to buy champagne.

1065 2800852 1500
And you ordered all the fucking sides.

1066 2802437 1959
- Tell him about the sides.
- I ordered sides, so...

1067 2804480 3461
Sides? $26,000 worth of sides?

1068 2808359 2001
What are these sides?
They cure cancer?

1069 2810528 1792
The sides did cure cancer.
That's the problem.

1070 2812405 1417
That's why they were expensive.

1071 2814240 1584
- Shut the fuck up.
- I'm serious.

1072 2815992 1917
- Stop.
- And EJ Entertainment?

1073 2817994 1792
What the fuck is EJ Entertainment?

1074 2820997 1625
Well, that's...

1075 2822707 1083
Yeah, Jordy, what's EJ Entertainment?

1076 2823875 1083
How do I describe this?

1077 2825042 1000
Jord, what is that?

1078 2826127 2084
- It's a fucking prostitution ring, Jordy!
- I know.

1079 2828337 2043
- That's what it is!
- That is what it is.

1080 2830506 1960
Isn't that the perfect description for it?

1081 2832550 2585
That is what it is.
But none of these were charged to me.

1082 2835219 1334
This is all of them.

1083 2836679 1751
- Oh, that was all us?
- It wasn't me though.

1084 2838514 1834
Fucking explain this shit to him!

1085 2840516 2877
These are all of your
fucking charges right here!

1086 2843519 2126
The IRS, they allow for T&A. It's fine.

1087 2845730 2334
T&E!

1088 2848149 1042
Yeah. I said T&E.

1089 2849275 1292
- No, no. You said T&A.
- No, I didn't.

1090 2850651 1000
Yeah, you did.

1091 2851736 2293
- When did I say that?
- You said T&A. It's T&E.

1092 2854113 1292
I know you're upset about the dinner,

1093 2855490 4294
and that makes sense because we did
spend too much money. But I said T&E.

1094 2859869 1626
Don't tell me what you said.
I heard what you said.

1095 2861579 1292
- Dad. He said T&A.
- He did?

1096 2862955 1376
Absolutely, no question.

1097 2864415 1125
I'm trying to...

1098 2865625 1041
I'm getting this close!

1099 2866751 1208
- Dad, relax.
- I'm getting this close.

1100 2868044 2460
That's what I'm saying.
I want you to open up more, Max.

1101 2870588 1042
He's gonna fucking kill you.

1102 2871714 1542
Why do you hold it in? Why do you...

1103 2873424 1626
Max, why do you hold it in?

1104 2875134 1709
That's it. Get the fuck out of here!

1105 2876969 2293
- No, no, no!
- Asshole, get out of here.

1106 2879597 1834
What kind of hooker takes credit cards?

1107 2881516 1041
A rich one.

1108 2882642 2334
At Stratton, there were
three kinds of hookers.

1109 2885061 2293
The Blue Chips, top of
the line, model material.

1110 2887438 1501
They cost between $300 and $500

1111 2889023 2793
and you had to wear a condom
unless you gave them a hefty tip,

1112 2891901 1876
which, of course, I always did.

1113 2893945 3544
Then came the NASDAQs,
who were pretty, not great.

1114 2897573 2335
They cost between 200 and 300 bucks.

1115 2899992 2460
Finally, there were
the Pink Sheets. Skanks.

1116 2902578 2877
They cost about 100 or less.
If you didn't wear a condom,

1117 2905540 1250
you'd have to get a penicillin shot

1118 2906874 2377
the next day
and pray your dick didn't fall off.

1119 2909335 1834
Not that we didn't fuck them, too.

1120 2911462 1626
Believe me, we did.

1121 2913923 2043
It's that slipped disc thing again.

1122 2916759 1709
I know what it is. You know, too much...

1123 2918886 1417
...with EJ Entertainment.

1124 2920388 1000
Pops.

1125 2921472 1334
How are things at home?

1126 2922974 1500
Well, not the best.

1127 2924850 2252
She just doesn't...
You know what I'm saying?

1128 2927562 1125
It's like the smell...

1129 2928771 1584
There's a smell,
there's an attraction thing.

1130 2930481 2543
After a while it kind of
fades away a little bit.

1131 2933109 1667
Yeah, well. It's supposed to fade away.

1132 2934860 1918
- Supposed to?
- That's marriage. You know...

1133 2936904 2585
Your mother and I, we've been
married a long, long time.

1134 2939615 1125
What do you think? We're...

1135 2940825 1834
We're jumping into bed
every two minutes?

1136 2942827 1292
- It doesn't work that way.
- I love her to death.

1137 2944370 2001
I want to stay married, Dad, but...

1138 2946831 958
It's crazy out there.

1139 2947873 1501
Some of these girls...
You should see them.

1140 2949458 1251
Oh, my God!

1141 2951335 1084
They're fucking...

1142 2952503 1876
The things they're doing now, Pops.

1143 2954505 2293
I mean... I mean, it's on
a whole other level.

1144 2956924 1542
- Really?
- And they're all shaved, too.

1145 2958593 1417
- Get out of here!
- All shaven.

1146 2960177 1334
- Are you kidding me?
- Yeah.

1147 2961596 2209
- Bald as a china doll.
- No bush?

1148 2963973 1917
- No bush.
- Oh, my God!

1149 2966017 3586
All of a sudden, one week, nobody
had anything down there anymore.

1150 2969687 1083
It's a new world.

1151 2970855 1917
They're bald from the eyebrows down.

1152 2972857 2460
- Wow.
- Nothing. Not a stitch. It's like lasers.

1153 2975526 1209
Wow. A new world.

1154 2977361 2502
I was born too... Too early.

1155 2980072 2085
I've never been a fan
of the bush, to be honest.

1156 2982450 1125
- Really?
- Yeah.

1157 2983659 1084
I don't mind it.

1158 2985119 1125
Dad.

1159 2986787 1918
I don't want you stressing out
about any of this.

1160 2988873 1167
How can I not get stressed out?

1161 2990124 1375
Look at the knuckleheads
you got working for you.

1162 2991584 1208
I know they're knuckleheads

1163 2992877 2209
but I need them to want
to live like me, you get it?

1164 2995379 1167
To live like me.

1165 2996922 1084
Jordy.

1166 2998132 3711
One of these days, the chickens
are gonna come home to roost.

1167 3004055 1584
You're looking at me like I'm crazy.

1168 3006057 3043
Crazy? This is obscene.

1169 3009435 1292
It was obscene.

1170 3011062 1375
In the normal world.

1171 3012772 2167
But who the fuck wanted to live there?

1172 3015900 2877
Go party your fucking cocks off!

1173 3021572 4170
We are about to become
fucking legends

1174 3025868 1834
on Wall Street!

1175 3028204 4086
We got plans up here
that's gonna take this company

1176 3032375 2960
into the fucking stratosphere!

1177 3038589 1501
Wolfie! Wolfie!

1178 3044178 1709
Fuck Merrill Lynch. Fuck them.

1179 3046055 2460
Why should they be taking all our
fucking money all the fucking time?

1180 3048599 1167
This way we become the underwriters.

1181 3049850 1543
It was our next big move.

1182 3051477 3586
Finding companies to take public. IPOs.

1183 3055147 1793
It was the only way
these Wall Street pricks

1184 3057024 3711
would ever stop thinking of us
as some shitkicker bucket shop.

1185 3060820 1208
We got Arncliffe International.

1186 3062196 1459
See, we were a little different.

1187 3063739 3586
We liked to get as fucked up as
possible during our business powwows

1188 3067410 2459
in order to stimulate
our free-flowing ideas,

1189 3069954 3002
which is why we were popping
these ludes like they were M&M's.

1190 3073666 1459
Steve Madden.

1191 3076627 1167
We own the fucking companies...

1192 3078504 1167
We own the companies...

1193 3079755 1918
Don't know what a lude is? I'll tell you.

1194 3081841 1959
Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1195 3083968 4670
Looks like those ludes are working
their magic on Donnie right now.

1196 3121881 1542
The Quaalude,

1197 3123507 2919
or lude, as it is commonly referred to,

1198 3126510 2502
was first synthesized in 1951

1199 3129096 2669
by an Indian doctor,
that's dots, not feathers,

1200 3131849 1417
as a sedative,

1201 3133350 3837
and was prescribed to stressed-out
housewives with sleep disorders.

1202 3137855 2251
But pretty soon someone figured out

1203 3140191 3752
that if you resisted the urge to sleep
for just 15 minutes,

1204 3144028 2334
you got a pretty kick-ass high from it.

1205 3146739 3627
Didn't take long for people
to start abusing ludes, of course.

1206 3150451 3169
And in 1982,
the U.S. government Schedule 1'd them.

1207 3153829 2043
Along with the rest of the world.

1208 3156207 3043
Which meant there was
only a finite amount of these things left.

1209 3159543 2752
No shit, you can't
even buy 'em anymore.

1210 3162713 2168
You people are all shit out of luck.

1211 3165049 1417
What are you saying? What is it?

1212 3166550 3169
Steve Madden.

1213 3169970 2377
Steve.

1214 3172640 1458
You remember those ads?

1215 3174183 2376
Those giant-headed girls
with the bug eyes

1216 3176644 1625
wearing those big clunky shoes?

1217 3179063 1500
My friend from school, Steve Madden.

1218 3180648 1375
His friend from school, Steve Madden.

1219 3182107 2794
Steve Madden was the name
in women's shoes at the moment.

1220 3184985 3711
And all of Wall Street was
begging to take his company public.

1221 3188781 1250
Go ahead, go ahead, what is it?

1222 3190115 1292
Except, guess who grew up with him?

1223 3191492 1792
- Women's shoes.
- Women's shoes.

1224 3193369 2543
My very own Vice President.

1225 3196372 1208
Women's shoes!

1226 3197915 1834
Diamond Donnie Azoff.

1227 3200751 1667
- Steve Madden.
- Steve.

1228 3202503 1334
Steve.

1229 3203921 1083
Hey, JB, JB, JB, JB.

1230 3205089 1167
You gotta come check
this fucking chick out.

1231 3206340 1751
Look at this. Look.

1232 3213222 2835
I would fuck that girl
if she was my sister.

1233 3216141 2460
I would let that girl
give me fucking AIDS.

1234 3219270 2126
You want to see the Wolf handle this?

1235 3223357 1501
She's hot.

1236 3225276 1417
Cristy.

1237 3231824 1834
Jordan, this is my friend Naomi.

1238 3233784 2543
- Hi. Nice to meet you.
- Naomi.

1239 3236412 1542
Naomi, nice to meet you.

1240 3238080 1709
You got an awesome place here.

1241 3240124 2084
I've don't think I've ever been
in a house this big before.

1242 3242293 1166
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

1243 3243627 1125
Beautiful beach out there.

1244 3244879 1125
Blair Hollingsworth.

1245 3247047 1251
Hi, Blair. Nice to meet you.

1246 3248674 1334
- Your name's Blair, right?
- Yeah.

1247 3250175 1209
You like to Jet Ski?

1248 3251886 1166
I've never done it before.

1249 3253137 1000
You've never Jet Ski'd in your life?

1250 3254221 1000
No, I've never Jet Ski'd.

1251 3255306 1417
You've never been on a Jet Ski?

1252 3256807 1167
How many times
are you gonna ask her?

1253 3258058 1376
She's never been on a Jet Ski.

1254 3259977 2168
I don't know.
Might ask her a couple more times.

1255 3262438 2376
Okay. Sure.

1256 3265441 2293
Hi. I'm Hildy. Nice to meet you.

1257 3267818 2001
- Hi.
- Jordan, Teresa needs your help.

1258 3270029 1292
Yeah, I'll be out in a couple of minutes.

1259 3271405 1334
Just tell her I'll be
out in a couple of minutes.

1260 3272823 1459
Why don't you tell your wife that?

1261 3274366 1000
I might do that, but I'm having

1262 3275451 1542
- a conversation right now.
- What am I, your secretary?

1263 3277077 1835
You know what,
I think we should get going.

1264 3278996 1167
Wait, wait. Where you guys going?

1265 3280289 1417
We gotta go.
We got two other parties to go to.

1266 3281874 1584
- We can stay for a drink.
- Yeah, stay for a drink.

1267 3283792 2043
No. We got two other parties
we're supposed to get to.

1268 3285961 1125
But we can stay for a drink...

1269 3287171 1167
She's

1270 3288839 1334
perfect.

1271 3290299 1500
- You like champagne?
- I do.

1272 3291884 1042
She's perfect.

1273 3293010 1375
Donnie, what the fuck are you doing?

1274 3294470 1709
You piece of...

1275 3304104 2377
You're gonna have
to excuse my friend. He gets...

1276 3306774 1167
Get the fuck out!

1277 3308025 2043
Jordan, you gotta fuck her, bro.
She's so hot!

1278 3310194 1041
Yeah, Donnie!

1279 3312404 1918
Let him fucking finish, Hildy.

1280 3314406 1626
That's fucking rude.

1281 3316408 1543
Have some fucking manners.

1282 3321830 2085
So, Bay Ridge,
that's near Staten Island, right?

1283 3324041 2293
Brooklyn, across the Verrazano Bridge.

1284 3326585 1417
Saturday Night Fever territory.

1285 3328128 1501
That's right. Guinea Gulch.

1286 3329838 2168
We call the Verrazano Bridge
the Guinea Gangplank.

1287 3332091 1083
Right.

1288 3333258 1626
So I presume you're Italian?

1289 3335094 1083
On my dad's side.

1290 3336261 3211
I'm also Dutch, German, English.

1291 3339890 1167
I'm a mutt.

1292 3341392 1166
Yeah. You're a mutt.

1293 3342726 2252
Yeah, I still have family
over there though, in London.

1294 3345187 2585
My Aunt Emma. She's the best.

1295 3347856 2961
Very British, you know.
She's a classy lady.

1296 3350901 1334
That explains it then.

1297 3352319 1000
Explains what?

1298 3353404 2793
It explains you. I mean,
you're a duchess, right?

1299 3356323 2377
The Duchess of Bay Ridge.

1300 3361412 1417
Excuse me.

1301 3362913 2001
Could I get a straw, please?

1302 3366083 1459
Thank you.

1303 3370546 5254
So I was a little surprised
you asked Cristy for my number.

1304 3376885 1251
Why is that?

1305 3379930 1918
Aren't you married?

1306 3383100 2293
Well... Yeah, but what?

1307 3385477 2085
Married people can't have friends?

1308 3389440 1792
We're gonna be friends?

1309 3392443 3085
Yeah. You don't want to be my friend?

1310 3399575 2126
We're not gonna be friends.

1311 3409960 2460
And at night I work on my designs.

1312 3412796 2418
I have an entire line of lingerie.

1313 3415299 2877
You know, camisoles, bustiers, panties.

1314 3419261 2335
She designs women's panties, too?

1315 3421680 1709
Oh, my God!

1316 3433650 2710
Come on, Jordan, think of a way
to get up to her apartment.

1317 3441492 2459
You wanna come up for
some tea or something?

1318 3445329 1584
Tea? Yeah.

1319 3447164 1751
- Like hot tea?
- Yeah.

1320 3448999 1292
Oh, yeah. That sounds nice. Yeah.

1321 3450459 2209
Tea. Fuck, yeah, I wanted
to come up for tea.

1322 3452836 2877
Like Darjeeling or rose hip,
something nice like that?

1323 3455923 1000
Sure.

1324 3457007 1334
This is Rocky.

1325 3458425 2210
Oh, who's this? Say hi, Rocky.

1326 3460886 1083
Hi, sweetheart.

1327 3462262 1084
Okay.

1328 3464014 2502
Why don't you light a fire or something
and I'll be right out.

1329 3467101 1792
- Yeah. Fire, here?
- Sure.

1330 3472314 1542
I like your painting here. It's...

1331 3480614 3002
God, help me. How do I fuck this girl?

1332 3487162 1084
You all right?

1333 3488330 2335
Yeah, yeah. Just trying
to light the fire here.

1334 3496380 1500
That's it. That's it, you're leaving.

1335 3497965 1876
Don't get involved.
Go home to your wife.

1336 3509810 1834
As you can probably guess,

1337 3511728 2544
I fucked her goddamn brains out...

1338 3514773 1334
Jesus Lord!

1339 3518944 1626
For 11 seconds.

1340 3531415 1542
Did you just come?

1341 3533083 1918
Oh, yeah, I just came.

1342 3536044 1334
Did you? Did you come?

1343 3537588 1584
- No.
- No?

1344 3539256 1083
Okay.

1345 3540465 2127
I'm still hard so just give me a sec.

1346 3543635 1459
Sure.

1347 3545387 1626
Come on, baby, come on.

1348 3549641 2085
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

1349 3557608 1375
Oh, God!

1350 3559276 1709
Fuck off, Rocky! Bad dog.

1351 3561195 1291
You have a biscuit
or something like that?

1352 3562571 1083
It's okay.

1353 3563739 1459
- Just keep going.
- Rocky, go play.

1354 3565282 1876
Go play, Rocky. Go, go, go, go.

1355 3569745 1292
You're crazy.

1356 3571121 1250
I couldn't get enough.

1357 3572456 2334
I mean, her pussy
was like heroin to me.

1358 3574875 2752
And it wasn't just about the sex, either.

1359 3577711 2001
Naomi and I got along. I mean, we...

1360 3579796 1835
We had similar interests and shit.

1361 3586970 1626
Choo-choo train.

1362 3588889 1083
Yeah.

1363 3597147 3711
I think I can. I think I can.
I think I can. I think I can.

1364 3606865 3294
Yeah, yeah.
Let's toke it all on there, huh?

1365 3611995 1376
Oh, shit!

1366 3623966 1166
You!

1367 3625217 2043
Get out of the fucking car!

1368 3627636 1042
Jesus Christ.

1369 3628762 2585
Son of a bitch! Oh, fuck!

1370 3632599 1834
Relax, sweetheart. Relax.

1371 3635018 2210
- Son of a fucking bitch!
- Okay, okay... Geez!

1372 3637312 1292
Okay, babe, stop!

1373 3638689 1125
Please.

1374 3639898 1084
Bitch!

1375 3641733 1626
- What are you doing...
- That whore from the party?

1376 3643443 1501
Jesus Christ!

1377 3645028 1084
What the fuck is wrong with you?

1378 3646196 1250
I thought you were at the fucking beach!

1379 3647531 1333
I didn't know you were here!

1380 3648949 1542
That's where you've fucking been?

1381 3650575 1710
With that fucking whore from the party?

1382 3652369 1417
I thought you were at the beach house.

1383 3653870 1376
How could you do this to me?

1384 3655330 2794
- Sweetie, come on...
- Who the fuck are you, Jordan?

1385 3658208 2752
You're like a completely
different fucking person!

1386 3661044 3127
I made a mistake.
I don't know what to tell you, babe. I...

1387 3664673 1208
I'm sorry.

1388 3666300 2543
- I'm sorry.
- Is that who... Is that what you want?

1389 3678854 1542
Do you love her?

1390 3686069 1459
Answer me.

1391 3709134 2043
I felt horrible.

1392 3712054 1959
Three days later, I filed for a divorce

1393 3714097 1751
and moved Naomi into the apartment.

1394 3720437 3419
Say what you will,
but the Duchess did have style.

1395 3723940 3128
She brought in a decorator,
feng shui'd the whole place.

1396 3727152 2376
She even hired a gay butler.

1397 3729613 2585
This guy was smart,
sophisticated, professional.

1398 3732282 1584
Really, really great.

1399 3734117 1167
Is that jasmine?

1400 3735660 2627
Yes, sir. I tried to stump you
this evening. Very good.

1401 3738622 1625
Very good. Great nose.

1402 3740332 1667
Except for that one time.

1403 3747422 1250
Oh, my God!

1404 3750300 1334
Oh, hey.

1405 3752052 1334
Is it Wednesday already?

1406 3754346 1250
Oh, don't stop.

1407 3755680 1084
What the fuck!

1408 3757224 1750
That is fucked up!

1409 3759434 1209
He must have thought we were still

1410 3760727 1584
at the Hamptons
this weekend, you know.

1411 3762396 1375
Where were they doing it,
sweetheart? In the bedroom?

1412 3763855 2669
They were everywhere. There were
two guys over there on the table.

1413 3766608 1250
There were more over here.

1414 3767943 1459
There were four right here.

1415 3769486 1667
Are you fucking serious? Right there?

1416 3771238 2835
- Why didn't you tell me?
- Oh, baby, it gets worse.

1417 3775575 2544
After they left, I checked the apartment.

1418 3778245 1083
Right. What?

1419 3779663 1834
What is it, babe? What?

1420 3781832 1083
Where's my money?

1421 3782999 1000
I don't know where your money...

1422 3784084 2001
Where is my fucking money?
Where is it?

1423 3786169 1960
I don't know where
your money is, Mr. Belfort.

1424 3788213 2251
- I didn't do anything.
- If you don't get...

1425 3790549 1292
He's lying through his fucking teeth.

1426 3791925 1167
Let's start from the beginning.

1427 3793176 1251
Let's start from the beginning, all right?

1428 3794511 1542
You invited some friends over, right?

1429 3796346 1667
One thing led to another.
Things got out of hand.

1430 3798098 1500
We understand that, we do.

1431 3799683 2418
We do blow all the time.
We're fucking degenerates ourselves.

1432 3802185 1084
Look at us, right?

1433 3803353 1584
But money was stolen
from my apartment.

1434 3805021 1584
Right from my sock drawer. All right?

1435 3806690 2084
Like I said, I don't know
where your money is.

1436 3808859 1375
Just start from the beginning.
Who came over?

1437 3810318 1042
It was just a normal day.

1438 3811445 1333
I knew you were coming home
the next day.

1439 3812863 2251
So everything would be fine.
It'd be cleaned up.

1440 3815198 1918
I got a little high at breakfast.

1441 3817200 1793
So I got a little happy. I had some eggs,

1442 3819077 1000
I had a little bit of ice cream.

1443 3820162 1834
And then I said,
"Who do I know that likes ice cream?"

1444 3822080 1459
It's my friend, Rudy. So I called Rudy.

1445 3823623 2460
- Who's Rudy?
- Yeah, who's Rudy?

1446 3827627 3336
- You know who Rudy is. Come on.
- Me? I don't...

1447 3831047 1126
- You know...
- Who the fuck is Rudy?

1448 3832257 1042
I don't know anyone named Rudy.

1449 3833383 1084
Last month. The Lollipop Club.

1450 3834551 1459
You know who Rudy was. Dancing...

1451 3836094 1417
You know who Rudy is?

1452 3839222 1376
I don't fucking know any...

1453 3840682 958
What do you mean?

1454 3841725 1083
So he went to The Lollipop Club?

1455 3842893 1584
Oh, he was
at The Lollipop Club for sure.

1456 3844561 1584
On the stage, grinding with everybody.

1457 3846229 2001
I got fucked up. I like to dance.

1458 3848356 1501
I don't know.
Maybe I met him, maybe I didn't.

1459 3849941 1626
I meet a lot of fucking people.

1460 3851776 1543
- What are you saying?
- $50,000 was stolen

1461 3853403 1209
from my fucking sock drawer!

1462 3854696 1501
All my girlfriend's jewelry is gone.

1463 3856281 1918
- Where the fuck is it?
...Rudy. What the fuck?

1464 3858283 2043
Did your fucking little faggot
friend Rudy take my shit?

1465 3860410 1667
Did he? Answer me!

1466 3862412 2251
Okay. Now I get it. Now I get why I'm...

1467 3864873 1083
This is a gay thing.

1468 3866166 1459
See, all of you...

1469 3867959 1292
You think this is 'cause you're a fag?

1470 3870045 1333
My cousin's a fucking faggot.

1471 3871463 2376
And I go on vacation with him
and his boyfriend. I love fags.

1472 3873924 1125
You were in charge, right?

1473 3875133 1709
I will not be stolen from. You get that?

1474 3876927 2167
I fucking like gay people. I don't like you.

1475 3879179 2626
He should've hired a fucking Mexican
like I have in my fucking house.

1476 3883558 1459
Shit! What the fuck...

1477 3889272 1334
Talk, you fuck, talk!

1478 3890690 1125
I'm gonna drop you, you faggot!

1479 3891900 1167
Where is it?

1480 3893318 2960
Chester and Toby,
they went all yakuza on Nicholas.

1481 3896363 1083
You know, they got crazy.

1482 3897531 1041
I don't know!

1483 3899241 3043
I had to call the cops just to keep
them from killing the poor guy.

1484 3902410 3586
I gave them each 1,000 bucks
and told them what Nicholas had done.

1485 3906289 1376
Then they kicked his ass.

1486 3908124 1376
Thanks again, Officer.

1487 3909834 2669
It's not like I cared about
the 50 grand anyway.

1488 3912587 1626
I was making that much
almost every day

1489 3914297 2252
through one rathole or another.

1490 3916633 2752
Now a rathole is a friend,
like Brad here,

1491 3919469 2543
who held stock in his name for me.

1492 3922138 2210
Who are you supposed to be, huh?
Jack Nickle-Jew?

1493 3924432 4796
I'd drive the price up then he'd sell
and kick most of the profits back to...

1494 3929312 1834
You guessed it, me.

1495 3933900 2543
All cash. None of it's on the books.

1496 3936528 2293
A big no-no, of course,
in the eyes of the law.

1497 3939864 2961
Enter our new securities
attorney, Manny Riskin.

1498 3943410 3169
700 bucks an hour
to be the voice of doom.

1499 3946663 1751
Listen to me. You piss up the SEC's leg,

1500 3948498 1209
you end up with your tits in a ringer.

1501 3949791 3002
Do not worry about it.
I have the SEC under control.

1502 3953169 2460
What the fuck
are these imbeciles doing?

1503 3955755 1334
Hey! Hey!

1504 3957173 1292
What are you doing? Hey!

1505 3958633 1876
We got the SEC in here.

1506 3960677 2001
The Securities
and Exchange Commission

1507 3962762 2585
sent two lawyers down
to review our files.

1508 3965432 1917
So I set them up in our conference room

1509 3967434 1083
and I had it bugged

1510 3968602 2209
and the air conditioning
turned up so high

1511 3970895 1543
that it felt like Antarctica in there.

1512 3972522 1959
Is it always this cold in here?

1513 3974566 1042
I don't know.

1514 3975692 1167
Then, while they were looking

1515 3976943 1417
for a smoking gun in that room...

1516 3978445 1792
Arncliffe International is on fire.

1517 3980947 2627
...I was gonna fire off a bazooka in here,

1518 3983658 2251
offering up our latest IPO.

1519 3985994 2501
An IPO is an initial public offering.

1520 3988580 3753
It's the first time a stock is offered
for sale to the general population.

1521 3992417 1876
Now, as the firm taking
the company public,

1522 3994377 1668
we set the initial sales price

1523 3996129 2752
then sold those shares
right back to our friends. The...

1524 3999132 1459
Look.

1525 4000717 1834
I know you're not following
what I'm saying anyway, right?

1526 4002677 1918
That's okay. That doesn't matter.

1527 4004679 1834
The real question is this.

1528 4006598 1876
"Was all this legal?"

1529 4008558 1876
Absolutely fucking not.

1530 4010810 2418
But we were making more money
than we knew what to do with.

1531 4017609 1125
And what do you do when you're making

1532 4018818 1459
more money
than you know what to do with?

1533 4026284 1417
Oh, my God!

1534 4028078 1667
Will you marry me?

1535 4030288 1334
Oh, my God.

1536 4031706 2001
Is that a yes?

1537 4034417 1042
Are you sure?

1538 4035543 1876
Yeah, I'm sure. Yeah, I'm sure.

1539 4037754 1709
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

1540 4049891 3461
I held my bachelor party
at the Mirage in Las Vegas.

1541 4053603 2210
The flight there alone was a bacchanal.

1542 4055980 4045
One last blowout for the gods
before I settled down for good.

1543 4060443 1417
A hundred Strattonites,

1544 4061945 2793
50 hookers, plus 50 more waiting
once we landed.

1545 4065448 1000
Oh, and the drugs.

1546 4066533 3836
I mean, I tell you, our plane was
like a pharmacy with wings.

1547 4099816 3336
All told, the weekend
cost me two million bucks,

1548 4104738 3502
including the cost
of refurbishing the entire 28th floor.

1549 4109659 1501
...kiss the bride.

1550 4112746 3460
But the wedding
was something out of a fairy tale.

1551 4116750 2626
With Naomi, my Duchess,

1552 4119461 1500
me, her handsome Duke,

1553 4121045 3044
and The Bahamas Ocean Club,
our castle.

1554 4134934 2877
Of course, after the bachelor party,
me, the Duke,

1555 4137896 2751
needed a few penicillin shots
so he could

1556 4140732 2126
safely consummate the marriage.

1557 4148239 1793
Hey! Barry Kleinman,
filming the wedding.

1558 4150241 1292
A few words for your son?

1559 4151659 2627
Jordan. Remember what I told you.

1560 4154370 3128
It involves your penis and her vagina.

1561 4157582 2960
And you know, you know
what you can do, Jordy.

1562 4178061 1292
Oh, my God!

1563 4179437 1376
Aunt Emma?

1564 4184901 2001
I can't believe you came!

1565 4187403 3169
Jordan! Jordan! Look who came!

1566 4191366 1041
It's Aunt Emma.

1567 4193451 1125
Aunt Emma.

1568 4194702 2335
- Oh, Jordan, dear, how lovely.
- Hey, how you doing?

1569 4197914 2668
It's a pleasure
to finally meet you in person.

1570 4201000 1584
Into the donuts, I see.

1571 4202669 2334
Oh, I... I...

1572 4205088 1208
Well...

1573 4207090 2334
I lived through the '60s, my dear.

1574 4209509 1459
Enjoy the day.

1575 4211302 2168
She surprised me. I didn't even know.

1576 4227777 1542
Just one more step. Are you ready?

1577 4229404 1584
- Where are we going?
- Keep your eyes closed.

1578 4231072 1375
One, two, three!

1579 4234909 1084
What is this?

1580 4236286 1834
- It's your wedding present.
- What?

1581 4238204 1334
It's your wedding present, sweetheart.

1582 4240999 1375
What?

1583 4242834 2126
- Are you serious?
- I'm serious.

1584 4245044 1125
A fucking yacht?

1585 4246796 2376
For millionaires
whose ships have come in,

1586 4249257 2793
pricey pleasure boats
are for the most fun afloat.

1587 4252135 3085
It's no coincidence that
its 150 feet of green hull

1588 4255305 2167
is the color of cash. Anchors aweigh!

1589 4257557 2251
Oh, my God! Baby!

1590 4262145 1625
- I think you like it?
- You're crazy.

1591 4263855 1417
- You like it?
- Yes!

1592 4270945 2794
For three weeks, we sailed
the Naomi through the Caribbean,

1593 4273823 2001
eventually taking her home
to Long Island,

1594 4275909 1083
where we bought a house.

1595 4277076 2585
Seven acres on
the Gold Coast of Long Island.

1596 4279787 2460
The most expensive
real estate in the world.

1597 4282332 2668
With maids, cooks, landscapers,
you name it.

1598 4285084 2460
We even had two guards
who worked in shifts.

1599 4287670 1042
Both named Rocco.

1600 4292842 2085
It was heaven on earth.

1601 4297805 1459
Wake up, you piece of shit!

1602 4300016 1042
Who's Venice?

1603 4301142 1334
- Huh?
- Who?

1604 4302560 1000
Who? Who?

1605 4303645 1667
"Who?" What are you, a fucking owl?

1606 4305396 1167
Who is she?

1607 4306689 1417
Some little hooker
you were fucking last night?

1608 4308191 1917
What the fuck are
you talking about? No.

1609 4310193 1584
No way, baby, no!

1610 4311861 2335
You were calling
her name in your sleep!

1611 4314280 2627
Are you out of your
fucking mind? I don't...

1612 4317450 1667
I don't even know who Venice is.

1613 4319202 2209
What the fuck does that
even mean? Venice.

1614 4321496 2751
That's the stupidest shit
I've ever heard in my fucking life!

1615 4328044 2168
Venice...

1616 4330713 2085
Venice, baby, where are you?

1617 4333508 3502
Venice!

1618 4337387 1417
Where'd you go?

1619 4342892 2752
Oh, baby.
Oh, you're gonna play rough, huh?

1620 4345728 2168
- Oh, Jesus Christ!
- You like that?

1621 4350233 2126
I like it. I like it.

1622 4352527 1709
Wolfie, Wolfie, Wolfie, Wolfie.

1623 4354320 1125
Wolfie?

1624 4355530 1292
Yeah, it's my safe word, baby.
It's my safe word.

1625 4356906 1417
I don't give a fuck about your safe word!

1626 4358408 2084
- Come on!
- Shut the fuck up!

1627 4360576 2377
Shut up, you little bitch!

1628 4363413 2126
You're a fucking dirty little birdy!

1629 4367458 1167
That's right.

1630 4368751 1251
That's right! I forgot.

1631 4370128 1458
I forgot, baby.

1632 4371713 4295
Donnie and I were investing
in a condominium complex in Venice.

1633 4376092 1125
That's why all this confusion.

1634 4377301 1543
Oh, you're investing in Italy?

1635 4378928 1709
Not Italy. California.

1636 4380722 1500
- Oh, California?
- Yeah.

1637 4382306 1126
You're a lying piece of shit!

1638 4383516 1167
Duchess, baby, come on.

1639 4384767 1542
Don't you fucking "Duchess" me.

1640 4386436 1417
Don't you "Duchess" me!

1641 4388104 2960
Do you really think that
I don't know what you're up to?

1642 4391190 1876
- You're a father now, Jordan.
- Yeah.

1643 4393151 1417
- You're a father now.
- I know...

1644 4394652 1709
And you're still acting like an infant!

1645 4397780 1542
God damn it!

1646 4399407 2668
Baby, you know,
you got real anger issues.

1647 4402577 1917
Who is the one who flew in here

1648 4404579 2877
at 3:00 in the morning
on their stupid helicopter

1649 4407540 2043
and woke up Skylar? That was you!

1650 4409667 2627
Oh, Skylar! Oh, fucking bullshit!

1651 4423139 3961
Does it even matter to you
that I just had that driving range

1652 4427310 3085
sodded with Bermuda grass, Jordan,

1653 4430480 2042
- and now you fucking wrecked it!
- Oh, my God... Bermuda grass.

1654 4432607 1750
No, you didn't research the whole thing

1655 4434442 2084
and deal with the fucking
golf course people!

1656 4436611 1167
Oh, my God,

1657 4437862 2543
you had to deal
with the golf course people, too!

1658 4440490 2668
What a Greek tragedy, honey!
Oh, my God!

1659 4443284 2877
You probably had to pay them
in cash with your hands!

1660 4446245 1209
What a fucking burden.

1661 4447538 1960
And actually do some work
besides swiping

1662 4449582 2126
my fucking credit card all day, huh?

1663 4451793 2710
Because I can't keep track
of your professions, honey.

1664 4454587 1876
'Cause last month
you were a wine connoisseur.

1665 4456547 2043
Now you're an aspiring
landscape architect!

1666 4458674 1668
- Let me get that right... No!
- Fuck you!

1667 4460426 2001
Don't fucking dare throw that

1668 4462512 2459
fucking water at me.
Don't you fucking dare.

1669 4465890 1459
All right, honey?

1670 4467725 1209
Now will you just...

1671 4469018 1876
We could talk this out, all right?

1672 4470978 2377
We just use our words. You know?

1673 4473439 1084
Communicate.

1674 4474607 1209
Okay?

1675 4476359 1292
Come on, sweetheart.

1676 4477860 1834
Talk to me. Talk to me.

1677 4479821 2042
Stop flexing your muscles, Jordan.

1678 4481948 1709
You look like a fucking imbecile.

1679 4483741 1292
Babe, come on.

1680 4485159 3127
You should feel happy
you got a husband

1681 4488371 2251
who's in such great shape
like this, huh?

1682 4491541 1125
Come here.

1683 4492750 1542
Come on, give me a kiss.

1684 4494377 1041
You look so beautiful right now.

1685 4495545 1083
- Come on.
- Kiss you?

1686 4496712 1167
- You look so beautiful...
- Kiss you?

1687 4497964 1625
Yeah, give me one...

1688 4500550 1333
Fuck you!

1689 4501968 2001
Ah, yes, my morning ritual.

1690 4504470 1959
First I'd get up and fight with Naomi

1691 4506514 2209
about whatever it is
I did the night before.

1692 4508808 2209
Next was a steam so I could sweat out

1693 4511102 1751
the drugs still in my system.

1694 4512937 1626
Then I'd assess the damage.

1695 4514814 1751
Drown out my eyeballs.

1696 4516732 2460
Take my "back pills"
to get the day started,

1697 4519277 2084
then seek to make up with Naomi.

1698 4521737 1668
Good morning, Daddy.

1699 4523990 1584
Where's my kiss?

1700 4527535 1500
Hey, sweetheart.

1701 4530830 2960
Does Daddy get a kiss from
both of his little girls, huh?

1702 4533916 1334
Oh, no.

1703 4535334 3086
No, Daddy doesn't even
get to touch Mommy

1704 4538504 1751
for a very, very,

1705 4540756 1334
very long time.

1706 4542633 2752
Daddy's really sorry
about what he said in the other room.

1707 4545469 1209
He didn't mean any of it.

1708 4546762 2293
Daddy shouldn't waste his time.

1709 4549599 1584
And from now on,

1710 4552602 2167
it's gonna be nothing but short,

1711 4554979 2210
short skirts around the house.

1712 4559817 2460
And you know something else, Daddy?

1713 4563529 5838
Mommy is just so sick
and tired of wearing panties.

1714 4571162 1959
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1715 4575499 1418
In fact,

1716 4578920 2751
she's decided to throw them

1717 4581756 3210
all away.

1718 4590765 1876
So take a good look, Daddy.

1719 4593059 3043
You're gonna be seeing
an awful lot of this around the house.

1720 4596187 1542
Oh, baby...

1721 4597813 1459
Yeah, Mommy.

1722 4599774 1917
- Yeah...
- But no touching.

1723 4602318 1542
Oh, gosh.

1724 4608366 1709
What's wrong, Daddy?

1725 4610159 1334
Baby.

1726 4613621 1208
God!

1727 4616499 1167
Look at this shit.

1728 4617792 3711
Okay. Mommy likes to
play games with Daddy.

1729 4623297 4545
Mommy, have you ever noticed
anything odd about Mr...

1730 4628302 1584
Mr. Fuzzy Bear over there?

1731 4632056 3127
His eyes seem
to be a little bit odd, don't they?

1732 4635685 3460
Yeah, there's something
a little bit different about his eyes.

1733 4639230 3210
Yes! I think it's true. Say "Hi," Mommy.

1734 4642525 1834
Say "Hi" to Rocco and Rocco.

1735 4644443 1334
Say "Hi." Hi, fellas.

1736 4645903 1376
See that, huh?

1737 4647363 1751
Of all the fucking days,

1738 4649198 1751
she chooses today
to give me blue balls!

1739 4651492 2627
I mean, today was
the biggest day in Stratton's history,

1740 4654203 1834
and I needed to be thinking straight.

1741 4656122 1417
Hey, Jordan!

1742 4657873 1835
- Welcome.
- Steve here yet?

1743 4659792 3127
This was the day that
we launched the Steve Madden IPO.

1744 4663087 2043
Troops are all here,
everyone's all rallied, excited.

1745 4665214 1793
Everything had to run tight.

1746 4667091 1042
It had to be perfect.

1747 4668217 2168
What the fuck is that kid doing?

1748 4670720 1333
What's he doing?

1749 4672763 1876
The biggest IPO in this firm's history.

1750 4674849 2168
What the fuck is he doing?

1751 4678060 1960
Is he... Is he wearing a bow tie?

1752 4680313 1083
Hi.

1753 4682565 1083
How're you doing?

1754 4683733 1000
Good.

1755 4685651 1793
You cleaning the fish bowl?

1756 4688529 2084
I just... I had a minute and...

1757 4691032 1375
You had a minute.

1758 4692700 2335
And today you needed
to clean the fish bowl? Today?

1759 4695119 3669
I had finished my paperwork
and I had a couple of minutes.

1760 4698956 1793
Okay. Nice to meet you.

1761 4706756 1250
On new issue day?

1762 4709675 2585
On cocksucking,
motherfucking new issue day?

1763 4712386 1167
This is what you do?

1764 4714096 2418
Hey, everybody, listen up!

1765 4717141 2627
This is what happens when you fuck
with your pets on new issue day!

1766 4733449 1834
Take your little bow tie, get your shit,

1767 4735618 1834
and get the fuck out of my office!
You understand?

1768 4737536 1501
Get the fuck out!

1769 4742708 1501
Everybody on point!

1770 4744293 2919
We are here to make money.
Everybody on point.

1771 4749715 2752
A real wolf pit,
which is exactly how I liked it.

1772 4752551 2627
Jordan, look what I caught in the lobby.
I caught a genius.

1773 4755304 1417
Enter Steve Madden.

1774 4756847 1084
The great American cobbler.

1775 4758015 2377
Red-hot ladies footwear impresario.

1776 4760935 3127
And thanks to Donnie,
we were taking his company public.

1777 4764146 3711
Stratton Oakmont was crawling out
of the primordial ooze.

1778 4768150 1793
Pond scum no more.

1779 4770277 1292
That's why they gotta see your face.

1780 4771654 2460
You get them fired up so they push
the shit out of this stock. Okay?

1781 4774198 2585
And not only that,
Donnie and I secretly owned

1782 4776867 2293
85% of Steve Madden Shoes,

1783 4779745 2001
which legally speaking was a big no-no,

1784 4781831 3377
but we'd get filthy fucking rich
if our troops got behind it.

1785 4785543 2251
Our job was to get them worked up.

1786 4787962 1709
But not too worked up.

1787 4791090 1375
Hello. If...

1788 4793509 2168
For those of you who don't know me...

1789 4795970 1041
My name's Steve Madden.

1790 4797096 1542
Yeah, we know who you are.

1791 4798931 1292
Your name is on the box.

1792 4800433 1542
Get the shoes. Show them the shoes.

1793 4802059 1584
- Show them the shoes.
- Okay. Yeah.

1794 4803936 3002
Anyway, you know,
this shoe is pretty cool.

1795 4807022 2836
This is the Mary Lou, which is really
the shoe that put me on the map.

1796 4809942 1584
Without it, I wouldn't be here.

1797 4811610 1167
It's a fat girls' shoe!

1798 4812862 1959
Believe it or not...
Believe it or not though,

1799 4814947 3294
the Mary Lou is actually the same
as the Mary Jane, but it's black leather.

1800 4822955 1626
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1801 4824665 2877
Fight back! Come on!
Where you at? Where you at?

1802 4827835 1292
All right!

1803 4829211 3253
Let's give it up for Steve Madden
and his awesome Mary Lou!

1804 4832548 2168
Hold that up. Hold that up.
Hold that up proud!

1805 4835050 2210
Give him a round of applause!

1806 4838471 2126
You guys got that
out of your systems, huh?

1807 4841557 2001
You having a good afternoon or what?

1808 4844101 3044
I wanna take a moment
and tell you why Steve here is so

1809 4847229 2293
absolutely off the fucking wall.

1810 4850733 3586
It's because this man
is a creative genius.

1811 4854904 3502
This ability, this gift that Steve has,

1812 4858532 3294
it goes beyond just
spotting the hottest shoe trends.

1813 4861911 3752
Steve's power is that he creates trends.

1814 4865998 1417
You understand?

1815 4867625 2084
Artists like Steve
come along once every decade.

1816 4869793 3420
I'm talking Giorgio Armani,
Gianni Versace, Coco Chanel,

1817 4873297 1626
Yves Saint Laurent.

1818 4875382 1626
Steve, come over here for a second.

1819 4877259 2001
I don't think you all realize

1820 4879929 1375
that Steve Madden

1821 4881639 3294
is the hottest person
in the women's shoe industry,

1822 4885017 1292
with orders going through the roof

1823 4886393 3336
at every department store
in North America right now.

1824 4890231 2001
We have him here in our office!

1825 4893275 2794
We should thank
our fucking lucky stars this man is here!

1826 4896153 2585
We should be on our hands
and knees right now,

1827 4898822 2085
getting ready to suck this guy off!

1828 4900991 2544
Like this! Okay?

1829 4903786 1625
I wanna suck you off, Steve!

1830 4906288 1584
Everyone's gonna suck you off!

1831 4908499 1250
This is our golden ticket

1832 4909959 2293
to the fucking chocolate
factory right here!

1833 4913170 1125
And I wanna meet

1834 4914463 2168
Willy fucking Wonka, okay?

1835 4917299 2835
I wanna be with the fucking
Oompa Loompas like this!

1836 4924223 2418
All right, get off this fucking stage!
Get out of here.

1837 4927184 2335
All right, I want all of you
to focus for a second.

1838 4930062 2001
See those little black boxes?

1839 4932314 1084
They're called telephones.

1840 4933482 2752
I'm gonna let you in on a little
secret about these telephones.

1841 4936318 2585
They're not gonna dial
themselves. Okay?

1842 4939029 3711
Without you, they're just
worthless hunks of plastic.

1843 4943367 3586
Like a loaded M16 without
a trained Marine to pull the trigger.

1844 4947997 2418
And in the case of the telephone,

1845 4950583 2626
it's up to each and every one of you,

1846 4954712 2084
my highly-trained Strattonites.

1847 4957923 1292
My killers!

1848 4959967 3294
My killers, who will not
take no for an answer!

1849 4964179 1543
My fucking warriors,

1850 4966181 2001
who will not hang up the phone

1851 4968267 3002
until their client either buys

1852 4971353 2168
or fucking dies!

1853 4988537 1542
Let me tell you something.

1854 4990164 3002
There is no nobility in poverty.

1855 4993626 3002
I have been a rich man
and I have been a poor man.

1856 4996712 2418
And I choose rich every fucking time.

1857 5000382 2669
Because at least as a rich man,
when I have to face my problems,

1858 5003135 3836
I show up in the back of a limo,
wearing a $2,000 suit

1859 5007056 2585
and a $40,000 gold fucking watch!

1860 5013896 1083
Duke it out! Hit him!

1861 5015064 1417
Get the fuck off me!

1862 5017941 4170
And if anyone here thinks
I'm superficial or materialistic,

1863 5022237 2252
go get a job at fucking McDonald's,

1864 5024573 2001
'cause that's where you fucking belong!

1865 5028702 3544
But before you depart
this room full of winners,

1866 5033040 3085
I want you to take a good look
at the person next to you. Go on.

1867 5037127 2252
Because sometime in
the not-so-distant future,

1868 5039797 3460
you're gonna be pulling up to a red light
in your beat-up old fucking Pinto,

1869 5043592 3044
and that person's gonna be
pulling up right alongside you

1870 5046720 2126
in their brand new Porsche

1871 5049682 2001
with their beautiful wife by their side,

1872 5051767 2001
who's got big voluptuous tits.

1873 5055437 2252
And who're you gonna be sitting next to?

1874 5057773 3294
Some disgusting wildebeest
with three days of razor-stubble,

1875 5061151 1334
in a sleeveless muumuu,

1876 5062569 2377
crammed in next to you
in a carload full of groceries

1877 5065030 1751
from the fucking Price Club!

1878 5066865 2293
That's who you're gonna
be sitting next to!

1879 5069243 2251
So you listen to me and you listen well.

1880 5071620 2210
Are you behind on your credit card bills?

1881 5074248 2168
Good! Pick up the phone
and start dialing!

1882 5076834 2543
Is your landlord ready
to evict you? Good!

1883 5079670 2168
Pick up the phone and start dialing!

1884 5081964 3252
Does your girlfriend think
you're a fucking worthless loser?

1885 5085300 3044
Good! Pick up the phone
and start dialing!

1886 5088470 3503
I want you to deal with your problems
by becoming rich!

1887 5094143 3294
All you have to do today
is pick up that phone

1888 5098647 2835
and speak the words
that I have taught you.

1889 5101775 1960
And I will make you richer

1890 5103861 3043
than the most powerful CEO
in the United States of fucking America!

1891 5106989 1167
Yeah!

1892 5109324 1251
Fuck, yeah!

1893 5111201 2085
I want you to go out there

1894 5114037 1793
and I want you to ram

1895 5116165 3252
Steve Madden stock
down your clients' throats

1896 5119501 2293
until they fucking choke on it!

1897 5122212 4254
Till they choke on it and they buy
100,000 shares! That's what I want.

1898 5126550 1542
Yeah! Fuck, yeah.

1899 5128177 1625
You be ferocious!

1900 5130012 1834
- You be relentless!
- Yeah!

1901 5131930 3294
You be telephone fucking terrorists!

1902 5136685 3586
Now let's knock this motherfucker
out of the park!

1903 5170594 4712
At 1:00 p.m., we opened
the stock for sale at $4.50 a share.

1904 5175474 3044
By 1:03, it was over $18.

1905 5178644 2293
Even the big Wall Street
firms were buying.

1906 5190864 1918
Of the two million shares
offered for sale,

1907 5192866 2961
a million belonged to me,
held in phony accounts by my ratholes.

1908 5195911 2168
Now once the price hit the high teens...

1909 5198247 2126
You know what? Who gives a shit?

1910 5200457 1959
As always, the point is this.

1911 5202543 4378
$22 million in three fucking hours!

1912 5208090 1834
Can you believe this shit?

1913 5210217 2209
- I fucking love this, baby!
- It's amazing!

1914 5212511 1417
Jordan!

1915 5214054 1292
Barry Kleinman's on the phone

1916 5215430 1626
- from Future Video.
- Who?

1917 5217140 1209
I don't know. He shot at your wedding.

1918 5218433 1042
He says it's urgent.

1919 5219601 2085
Urgent? Who the fuck
is Barry Kleinman?

1920 5221770 1584
Oh, my God, you wanna marry me?

1921 5223438 1042
You're in love with me?

1922 5224565 1041
Yeah. Go fuck your cousin!

1923 5225732 1000
Hey, Barry, what's up?

1924 5226817 2126
Listen, I got this subpoena.

1925 5229027 1459
Subpoena? What the fuck
are you talking about?

1926 5230571 2626
Yeah, the FBI, they want
a copy of your wedding video.

1927 5233282 1166
The fucking FBI?

1928 5234658 1834
- You fucking kidding me?
- Listen to me.

1929 5236577 1292
His name is Denham.

1930 5237953 1667
He's an agent with the New York office.

1931 5239705 1041
What's his problem?

1932 5240831 2626
He's a Boy Scout.
He thinks you're fucking Gordon Gekko.

1933 5244751 1251
What does he want
with my wedding video?

1934 5246086 1626
It's like an invasion of my privacy.

1935 5247796 1334
You know what I'm saying? It's like...

1936 5249256 1292
It's intrusive, you know.

1937 5250632 2669
He's got pictures of your
whole inner fucking circle.

1938 5253385 1834
Pictures, names of the people.

1939 5255304 1000
You know what he's trying to do?

1940 5256388 1125
Exactly what he's doing.
Look at yourself.

1941 5257639 1167
He's trying to rattle you,

1942 5258891 1500
he's trying to rattle your old lady,

1943 5260475 2710
so she nags you until
you become a fucking witness.

1944 5263270 1459
He wants me to rat on myself?

1945 5264813 1793
He wants me to
give information about my...

1946 5266982 1542
Listen. The good fucking news is,

1947 5268609 1792
you know I know everybody downtown,

1948 5270485 2210
I call up the Justice Department,
the DEA,

1949 5272779 3086
nobody even knows you fucking exist,
so calm down!

1950 5276158 1208
They don't know I exist?

1951 5277659 1626
- No.
- That's good.

1952 5284291 1042
But you...

1953 5285417 1459
You know who he is, right?

1954 5287628 1959
- Yeah.
- So, if I just wanted to get

1955 5289671 1960
some more information,
just find out what he knows,

1956 5291715 3211
you could go to his house, right?

1957 5295010 1876
Tap his phones a little bit, bug him.

1958 5296970 1125
You could get some information...

1959 5298180 2793
You don't fuck with these guys like that.

1960 5301058 1083
You don't fuck with them like that.

1961 5302225 1167
What are you, nuts or something?

1962 5303477 1625
This is what you fucking do.
What do I pay you for?

1963 5305187 3085
I have a fucking P.I. license, you know?
I make a living at this.

1964 5308357 1083
I'm not a cop anymore.

1965 5309524 2001
They'll take my fucking license
away from me, all right?

1966 5311610 1083
Okay.

1967 5313403 2252
Okay, if I can't do that, can I just...

1968 5315948 1250
Can I give the guy a call?

1969 5318408 2001
- Why? Is that...
- Jordan. Jordan.

1970 5320494 1000
Do me a favor?

1971 5321578 2919
The only one who calls this guy
is your fucking lawyer.

1972 5324581 1000
I can't call him, right?

1973 5325666 1750
- It's against the rules?
- I told you,

1974 5327501 1667
whatever the fuck you say to him,

1975 5329252 2627
he's gonna use against you.
Don't you understand?

1976 5331964 1750
He's smart, you're dumb.

1977 5333799 1250
Fucking bullshit.

1978 5335634 2501
Are we fucking talking tonight,
or are you gonna get schwacked?

1979 5338220 1542
The last time you
took these fucking pills,

1980 5339888 1959
you put your head in the
fucking macaroni. I had to pick it up.

1981 5342933 1459
All right.

1982 5344476 1542
Okay, I won't call him.

1983 5348939 3919
Hey, fellas! Come on board.
The plank's right around there.

1984 5353735 1376
Welcome!

1985 5355821 2084
What a nice day.

1986 5359157 1084
Hey.

1987 5360701 1542
Welcome aboard.

1988 5362744 2627
Jordan. Welcome aboard the Naomi.
Pleasure to meet you.

1989 5365455 1584
Agent Denham. This is Agent Hughes.

1990 5367124 1041
Hi, how are you?

1991 5368250 3252
Let me introduce you. This is Nicole,
Heidi. Come on. Don't be shy.

1992 5371586 2502
What are you guys all shy for?
Don't be scared.

1993 5374172 1167
These are friends of Stratton.

1994 5375424 1500
- It's a pleasure.
- Hello.

1995 5379594 3461
Your message said that
you wanted to speak privately.

1996 5383265 1667
Right. I do want to speak privately.

1997 5385100 1250
Give us a minute, huh, ladies?

1998 5386435 1584
Let me know if I can get you anything.

1999 5388103 1834
We'd be happy to help.

2000 5390147 1041
You guys hungry?

2001 5391273 2793
Want something to eat?
Got some pasta, shrimp, lobster.

2002 5394151 2376
I got whiskey.
Any kind of booze you want.

2003 5396611 1459
You know what?
The Bureau doesn't allow us

2004 5398155 1417
to drink while we're at sea.

2005 5399740 2459
Duh! Of course.

2006 5402284 1834
Ever been on one of these before?

2007 5404286 1250
A boat?

2008 5406288 1292
I learned how to sail when I was six.

2009 5407664 2085
No shit. Is that right? Really?

2010 5409833 1709
On one like this, though?

2011 5411626 2794
I had the whole front extended in order
to fit the chopper up there.

2012 5414546 1292
See that?

2013 5417132 1459
Anyway, this is for you.

2014 5418675 2835
It's a complete list of every person
that was at my wedding.

2015 5421595 2751
I understand you wanted
the whole wedding video.

2016 5424431 2752
Figured this would help expedite
the whole process, right?

2017 5427267 1751
- There you go.
- Look,

2018 5429102 2919
my point is that
I know you're investigating Stratton.

2019 5432105 3503
But for the life of me,
I can't figure out why.

2020 5435984 1375
I know we're a little unorthodox,

2021 5437444 1709
we're a little loud in
the way we do things.

2022 5439237 1125
But you gotta understand,

2023 5440447 1459
we're the new guys
on the block, you know,

2024 5441990 2126
we're trying to make
a name for ourselves.

2025 5444201 4628
But I want you to understand,
we don't do anything illegal.

2026 5449623 1083
Whatsoever.

2027 5450791 1542
I mean, you could talk to the SEC.

2028 5452417 3044
They were at my office 15 times
over the last six months.

2029 5455545 2627
I mean, I got... I got nothing to hide.

2030 5458256 2752
Well, you know the SEC
is a civil regulatory agency.

2031 5461093 1542
We pursue criminal activities.

2032 5462719 2835
Exactly! You go after real criminals,

2033 5466139 3044
which makes me wonder what
the hell you're investigating me for?

2034 5469309 1334
I mean, honestly...

2035 5470727 3836
What is it that you think
that we did or do? I don't get it.

2036 5474689 1251
Well, I...

2037 5476024 2418
Look, Jordan, I can't discuss
an ongoing investigation.

2038 5478527 1667
No, I get that. No, I understand.

2039 5480320 1375
With that said...

2040 5482572 1834
This case got dumped on my desk...

2041 5484491 1834
- Did it?
- You know, by a higher-up

2042 5486409 3211
who needs to make a show of looking
into the new company on the block,

2043 5489704 1459
- with all the press and everything.
- New loud guys.

2044 5491289 3545
And then I end up being the schmuck
who does the looking. Exactly.

2045 5494918 1918
It's just, you know... It bothers me.

2046 5496920 2543
We're the new guy. We're the one
that's banging on Wall Street's door.

2047 5499548 1083
I mean, you should...

2048 5500715 1918
You should see what's going on
at the bigger firms.

2049 5502717 1459
I mean, I know all the information.

2050 5504344 2794
It's true! Goldman,
Lehman Brothers, Merrill...

2051 5507222 2001
Collateralized debt obligations?

2052 5509349 1250
This Internet stock bullshit?

2053 5510684 1792
I mean, it's a fucking travesty.

2054 5512561 5004
I could take you step-by-step
through what exactly is occurring.

2055 5517816 1584
All you have to do is ask.

2056 5519568 1292
I'm available.

2057 5521027 1376
That's exactly what I wanted to hear.

2058 5522487 2877
I don't see why a little sitdown like this

2059 5526241 1542
can't be profitable for the both of us.

2060 5527909 2252
It should. Right?
It should profit the both of us.

2061 5530245 1500
- It should.
- Look.

2062 5532289 2209
I'm gonna give you my personal line.

2063 5534583 2918
Five days a week,
you just call me, feel free.

2064 5537711 1709
- I'll do that.
- Great.

2065 5542007 1667
Are you sure you guys
don't want something to drink?

2066 5543758 1668
You're not hungry? Nothing?

2067 5545510 1626
- Nothing? No?
- Oh, no.

2068 5550265 2585
Let me ask you,
and if you don't wanna get too personal,

2069 5552934 2293
just tell me to shut up at any time.

2070 5556104 2627
Did you try to get your
broker's license at one time?

2071 5558815 2835
Did I hear that right? Were you trying
to take a stab at Wall Street?

2072 5562569 1917
- No?
- Who you been talking to?

2073 5564571 1000
Who the fuck you been talking to?

2074 5565655 2752
Well, you're investigating me.
I hear things.

2075 5568491 2085
You know what I mean?

2076 5570660 1584
You ever think about
what would've happened

2077 5572329 2459
if you would have stayed the course?

2078 5576208 1834
You know what?
When I'm riding home on the subway

2079 5578126 1250
and my balls are fucking sweating,

2080 5579461 1792
I'm wearing the same suit
three days in a row...

2081 5581338 1500
Yeah, you bet I do.

2082 5582923 1667
I've thought about it before.
Who wouldn't, right?

2083 5584674 1042
Right, who fucking wouldn't?

2084 5585800 1167
What do you get...

2085 5587052 1250
Another personal question,
no need to answer...

2086 5588386 1376
No, that's all right, Jordan.

2087 5589846 3044
What do you pull in? 50, 60K?
Something like that?

2088 5593016 2001
A year? In the ballpark?

2089 5595101 1459
Well, I...

2090 5596645 1792
Let's put it this way.

2091 5598521 2794
You get a free handgun
when you sign up for the Bureau.

2092 5602067 2126
No, but it fucking pisses me off.
You know what I mean?

2093 5604277 2168
You think about the people
that built this country,

2094 5606529 1418
hardworking people like you.

2095 5608031 2543
Firefighters, teachers, FBI agents.

2096 5610700 3670
End of the day, you guys get
fucking skinned alive financially.

2097 5614454 1876
It fucking makes me angry.

2098 5616414 3086
Now the one thing about
Wall Street and this market is,

2099 5619584 1668
for me, I feel

2100 5622337 2335
it's good to give back.
You know, there's...

2101 5624756 2168
There are situations where I can

2102 5627008 3544
make those situations better for people.
You know?

2103 5630637 1292
You know what I mean.

2104 5632013 1417
Opportunity

2105 5633723 1251
is everything.

2106 5635058 1250
Exactly.

2107 5636434 2460
Take for example,
I got this one kid, right?

2108 5638979 3794
Went to school for environmental
science, something like that.

2109 5642857 1793
He was bogged down by student loans.

2110 5644734 2710
Turns out, his mother
needed triple bypass surgery.

2111 5647529 1417
- Jesus.
- Right. Horrible situation.

2112 5649030 959
Sure.

2113 5650073 1083
But we got him into the market

2114 5651241 1709
at the right time
and chose the right stock.

2115 5653034 1751
We gave him the right guidance.

2116 5654869 3169
Boom! Overnight,
changed his entire life.

2117 5658164 3336
Got to put his mother into
the best hospital in New York City.

2118 5661584 2877
It didn't work out for her, granted,
she passed away, unfortunately.

2119 5664546 1917
But we gave him that opportunity.

2120 5666548 1167
You know what I'm saying?

2121 5668425 4503
It's just about setting up the right team,
and then overnight your life can change.

2122 5678310 2418
What does... What does an intern...

2123 5682272 1876
What does an intern
make in a deal like that?

2124 5684232 2043
Well, in that situation,

2125 5687193 3044
in that particular trade,
and it was one trade,

2126 5690572 2501
north of half a million dollars.

2127 5696703 2251
And I'd do that for anybody, you know,

2128 5699039 2668
anybody that needs
the proper guidance.

2129 5721519 4087
Can you say that again,
just the way you said it?

2130 5726024 1709
Just the same way.

2131 5731946 1084
I don't know what you're talking about.

2132 5733114 2252
Oh, come on! You know
what I'm talking about.

2133 5735450 2001
I think what Jordan just did is he...

2134 5737535 1125
- If I'm not mistaken...
- No.

2135 5738745 2126
...you just tried to bribe a federal officer.

2136 5740955 2085
No, technically I didn't bribe anybody.

2137 5743124 2418
No, no, that's not
the conversation I heard, Jordan.

2138 5745627 1500
No, no, according
to the U.S. criminal code,

2139 5747212 3419
there needs to be an exact dollar figure
for the exchange of services.

2140 5750715 1626
That would not hold up in a court of law.

2141 5752425 1668
Nah, it's not how I heard it.

2142 5754177 2710
No, no, no, that's the truth.
But I want to tell you this.

2143 5756971 1000
Yeah.

2144 5758056 1500
The same gentleman that told me

2145 5759641 1751
that you tried to get
your broker's license

2146 5761476 2126
also told me that
you are a straight arrow.

2147 5763728 1459
He ran a security check on me.

2148 5765271 1209
Well...

2149 5766606 2960
Yeah, when you sail
on a boat fit for a Bond villain,

2150 5769651 2668
sometimes you need to
play the part. Right?

2151 5773113 1917
I think it's time you both
get the fuck off my boat.

2152 5775156 1251
What do you say?

2153 5777492 1250
You know, Jordan,
I'll tell you something.

2154 5778827 3002
Most of the Wall Street
jackasses that I bust,

2155 5782247 2334
they're to the manor born.

2156 5784666 1083
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

2157 5785834 3627
Their fathers are douchebags,
just like their fathers before them.

2158 5790588 1417
But you...

2159 5793716 2293
You, Jordan,
you got this way all on your own.

2160 5796177 1167
Did I?

2161 5797429 2084
- Good for you, little man.
- Little man?

2162 5799639 1250
Good for you.

2163 5801015 1126
Me, the little man?

2164 5802225 1042
And let me tell you something.

2165 5803351 1834
Let me tell you something else.

2166 5805311 2168
Honestly, I'm not bullshitting here,

2167 5807647 1125
this is one of the nicest boats

2168 5808857 2001
- that I've ever been on, I gotta tell you.
- I bet it is.

2169 5810942 1417
And you know
what I was just thinking, too?

2170 5812485 3252
The fucking hero that I'm gonna be
back at the office

2171 5815864 2167
when the Bureau seizes
this fucking boat.

2172 5818158 2167
Because, I mean,
fuckety-fuck-fuck, Jordan,

2173 5820410 1292
look at this thing!

2174 5822078 1042
It's beautiful!

2175 5823204 2961
And you got the beautiful girls there.
It's wonderful.

2176 5826249 2460
All right, get the fuck off my boat.

2177 5828877 1542
I'm sure we'll be seeing each other

2178 5830503 1042
- real soon.
- I'm sure.

2179 5831629 3461
Good luck on that subway ride home
to your miserable, ugly fucking wives.

2180 5835175 3085
I'm gonna have Heidi lick some caviar
off my balls in the meantime.

2181 5838386 2627
Hey, you guys want to take
some lobsters for your ride home?

2182 5841097 2627
Fucking miserable pricks,
I know you can't afford them!

2183 5843808 2085
Fucking cheap fucks.

2184 5846060 1960
Fucking miserable pricks.

2185 5848104 3211
Hey, fellas! Look what
I found in my pocket! Look!

2186 5851608 1750
A year's salary right here.

2187 5853443 2668
You know what I call them?
Fun coupons!

2188 5856196 1250
See that!

2189 5857989 2001
They're fun coupons!

2190 5867790 2752
Switzerland?
What the fuck is in Switzerland?

2191 5870668 2001
Swiss fucking banks, that's what.

2192 5872754 2668
It was ass-covering time.
I had to hide my money.

2193 5876716 1542
Enter Rugrat.

2194 5878384 1626
He knew this Swiss banker
from law school.

2195 5880094 1042
That's for European pussy!

2196 5881221 1250
But he was in Geneva.

2197 5882555 2377
And there was no way
I was gonna make that flight sober.

2198 5886768 1625
So I knew if I took my drugs right,

2199 5888478 2043
I could sleep through the entire flight.

2200 5890939 2334
But I had to take them just right.

2201 5893900 2043
At 4:00 p.m., I popped a few more ludes,

2202 5896027 1459
which started kicking in by the time

2203 5897570 1751
I finished my sales meeting.

2204 5899572 1209
My tingle phase.

2205 5901115 1668
By dinner, I popped a few more

2206 5902867 2919
on top of some cocktails
and a Valium or two.

2207 5905954 1500
My slur phase.

2208 5909624 2335
By 8:30, I took a few more ludes

2209 5912168 2585
and pretty much lost all my motor skills.

2210 5915004 1501
This was the drool phase.

2211 5919551 3377
And by 10:00, I didn't know
who or what the fuck I was.

2212 5923012 1584
The amnesia phase.

2213 5925515 1959
We boarded the plane
just before midnight.

2214 5927559 1709
Wow! Look at you!

2215 5929352 1959
- You're beautiful.
- Excuse me, sir.

2216 5931521 2168
His sleeping pills just kicked in.
He's all right.

2217 5933773 1542
May I see your boarding passes, sir?

2218 5935400 1750
We have the boarding passes.

2219 5937277 2001
Jesus Christ, I wanna fuck her.

2220 5939904 1709
Hey! Fucking relax.

2221 5941823 2042
Oh, my God!
You got your hand on my fucking cock!

2222 5943950 1375
I don't. Cut it out.

2223 5945410 1000
He's got his hand on my dick again.

2224 5946494 1000
I'm just trying to buckle you up.

2225 5947579 1208
You got your hand on his dick?

2226 5948871 1960
You gotta stop doing that
in public places.

2227 5950915 1959
Oh, my God. Take it off!

2228 5953167 1000
Take it off!

2229 5954252 2710
I heard there's
a treasure map under here.

2230 5957088 2543
- Stop! I know, miss.
- Excuse me, sir.

2231 5959716 1500
Please sit down.

2232 5961301 1458
- Watch it.
- Go back to your seat, please.

2233 5962844 2293
- What are you upset about?
- Please go back to your seat.

2234 5965221 1876
I will have to call the captain.

2235 5967181 2502
Please, sir, please, sir. Sit down.

2236 5969767 1668
Please sit down!

2237 5971519 1584
- I'm going! Stop.
- Okay, sorry.

2238 5973187 1626
We apologize. We're gonna go to sleep.

2239 5974897 1209
Question. I wanna ask you a question.

2240 5976190 1543
Fasten your seat belt, sir.

2241 5978359 1542
We cannot take off
if you haven't fastened

2242 5979986 1042
- your seat belt.
- I'm really horny, too.

2243 5981112 1125
Sit down. Fasten it.

2244 5982322 1500
- Right. Okay, I'll sit down...
- I will do it for you.

2245 5983906 1000
- What?
- I'll do it for you.

2246 5984991 1167
You gotta speak English.

2247 5986242 1959
We don't understand
this language you're speaking.

2248 5988286 1500
I will help him with his seat belt.

2249 5991039 1959
- You gotta put it on right.
- Sit back. Sit back, sir.

2250 5993207 2001
- There you go.
- All right. I'll just lean back...

2251 5997545 1667
Bitte, Hilfe!

2252 6014479 1292
Jesus Christ!

2253 6015855 1375
Fuck!

2254 6018900 1375
Donnie...

2255 6020401 3086
Donnie, this isn't funny.
You gotta untie me, buddy.

2256 6024113 1709
I can't untie you.

2257 6025907 2835
The captain tied you up.
He almost fucking tasered you.

2258 6029702 2418
Why?

2259 6033831 1251
He's got a fear of flying.

2260 6039462 1542
He's very nervous on planes, I'm sorry,

2261 6041089 1792
it's not you, sweetheart,
don't beat yourself up.

2262 6043174 2752
Easy, easy. He's fine.
He's just a nervous flyer.

2263 6046094 2167
You were screaming at people.

2264 6048346 1375
Oh, fuck off.

2265 6049806 2126
You were on the floor
rolling around and shit.

2266 6052016 1042
Oh, Jesus.

2267 6053142 2085
You called the captain the N-word.

2268 6055311 1501
I called the captain the N-word?

2269 6056938 2209
- Yeah, he was very upset.
- Really?

2270 6059273 2335
- Luckily we're in first class.
- Jesus.

2271 6062443 2835
Jesus Christ, I think
you have a fucking drug problem.

2272 6066572 2418
Where are the ludes?

2273 6070034 1501
They're up my ass. Don't worry about it.

2274 6071619 1584
- I got it.
- Okay.

2275 6073287 1584
Thank God.

2276 6075331 2460
Jesus Christ, what are we gonna do
when we get to Switzerland, buddy?

2277 6077917 1000
This is bad.

2278 6079001 2335
Fucking things are against
my chest. I can't breathe.

2279 6081462 1751
Come on, do something
to calm me down. Please.

2280 6083297 1709
Okay, shut the fuck up. Shut the fuck up.

2281 6085591 1084
Okay.

2282 6088302 1251
- That's good.
- Go to sleep.

2283 6089637 1125
Rub it harder, buddy.

2284 6090888 1584
You're all right.

2285 6092849 2293
We all love you. Shut the fuck up!

2286 6100982 2877
Mr. Belfort, you're free to go.

2287 6105987 1167
Really?

2288 6111200 1125
- Hey, Donnie.
- Yeah?

2289 6112410 1500
When we get out there,
try not to act like yourself.

2290 6113995 2293
Okay? Let's make Geneva
an asshole-free Donnie zone, all right?

2291 6116372 1417
What are you fucking coming at me for?

2292 6117874 1542
Hey, listen. The only reason
you're sitting in this limo

2293 6119500 1584
and not in a Swiss jail
is because of my friend. Okay?

2294 6121169 1166
Hilfe!

2295 6123296 2418
We're here. We're here.
Everyone calm down.

2296 6126215 1417
Jordan Belfort!

2297 6127717 1250
At last.

2298 6129051 2585
Nicholas has told me
so much about you.

2299 6131721 1876
Jordan, Jean Jacques Saurel.

2300 6133848 2376
- Pleasure to make your acquaintance.
- Nice to meet you.

2301 6136809 1209
It's a joke.

2302 6138144 2251
You'll understand
when you're in the fucking seat.

2303 6140772 1583
You need a bigger couch. For guests.

2304 6142440 1709
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
I don't understand. I'm sorry.

2305 6144233 2835
I'm curious about
your bank secrecy laws here.

2306 6148696 3169
Wait. Yes. Excusez-moi, Jordan.

2307 6152450 3044
Swiss custom requires 10 minutes of...

2308 6155620 1000
Blah, blah, blah.

2309 6156704 1626
- Chit chat.
- Yeah, chit chat, thank you.

2310 6158414 1626
...before business can be discussed.

2311 6161584 1125
Yeah.

2312 6165505 1041
Of course.

2313 6167215 2793
Let's get down to it.
What would you like to know?

2314 6170551 2877
Under what circumstances
would you be obligated

2315 6173513 2167
to cooperate with an FBI

2316 6176057 3085
or a U.S. Justice Department
investigation, for example?

2317 6179769 1167
ça depend.

2318 6181562 1125
ça depend?

2319 6182772 1000
Oui.

2320 6184857 2669
Ça depend on what, exactly?

2321 6188319 2251
Whether America plans
to invade Switzerland

2322 6190655 1584
in the coming months.

2323 6192698 2210
Shall I check if tanks
are rolling down the Rue de la Croy?

2324 6194992 2085
- Yes. Rue de la Croix.
- Croix. Croix.

2325 6197161 2835
Not Croy. Not Rue de la Croy. It's Croix.

2326 6200206 2209
See, this is what he used to do
back in law school. Check me.

2327 6202500 1751
- Champagne. Champagne.
- Yeah.

2328 6204335 2376
Yeah, yeah.
French fries, pommes frites.

2329 6207463 2543
- And that kind of stuff.
- That's funny.

2330 6211425 5046
What I'm asking, you Swiss dick,
is are you going to fuck me over?

2331 6219100 3669
I understand perfectly,
you American shit.

2332 6224939 2376
The only way
the Banque Réal de Genève

2333 6227400 2084
would cooperate
with a foreign legal body

2334 6229610 4128
is if the crime being pursued
is also a crime in Switzerland.

2335 6233865 4545
But there are very few Swiss laws
which apply to your practices.

2336 6239620 1626
From a financial standpoint,

2337 6241330 3086
you are now in heaven.

2338 6244584 1875
See, I told you he was fantastic, right?

2339 6247211 4545
If the U.S. Justice Department
sent us a subpoena, it would become

2340 6252216 1626
papier toilette.

2341 6254719 2251
We would wipe our ass with it.

2342 6257638 2585
Unless, of course,
it was an investigation

2343 6260308 1834
into stock fraud,

2344 6262226 2168
which is a crime here in Switzerland,
if I'm correct.

2345 6264478 4003
Then there would
have to be coopération on your part,

2346 6268608 1959
- if I'm not mistaken.
- Yes.

2347 6270735 2418
Yes, we would.

2348 6273321 2543
Assuming the account
is under your name.

2349 6277074 3044
If it were another name,

2350 6281329 1625
a friend's, camarade...

2351 6283039 1083
Cousin?

2352 6288878 1709
- Relative?
- Yeah.

2353 6292798 2627
Was that yodeling I just heard

2354 6295551 2460
or did you just say
what I thought you said?

2355 6298095 1751
Yes. Yes.

2356 6300598 2543
He's telling me to use a fucking rathole.

2357 6303351 1667
But a U.S. rathole would never get

2358 6305102 2210
into Switzerland with all that money.

2359 6307396 3836
What I needed was a rathole
with a European passport.

2360 6318532 1418
Jordan.

2361 6320034 2877
Hey. How's my favorite aunt, huh?

2362 6322995 1417
Welcome. Was the traffic terrible?

2363 6324497 1542
Oh, no, not at all.

2364 6328584 1626
Jordan, come in.

2365 6330378 2501
Thank God Aunt Emma
didn't need too much convincing.

2366 6333547 2502
Turned out the British
weren't too different from the Swiss.

2367 6336217 2501
Money talks and bullshit takes the bus.

2368 6339178 1918
How do you say "rathole" in British?

2369 6341514 2460
If you get into any trouble whatsoever,

2370 6344058 2752
I'll come forth immediately.
I'll say that I duped you.

2371 6346894 1292
That I promise.

2372 6348896 2668
Risk is what keeps us young,
isn't it, darling?

2373 6355903 1793
Sometimes I wonder

2374 6357989 3002
if you let money get
the best of you, my love.

2375 6361117 3127
Among other substances.

2376 6368666 1375
It's that obvious, huh?

2377 6370126 3252
It's chilly, darling,
and you're sweating bullets.

2378 6376090 1834
What can I say? I'm...

2379 6378801 1667
I'm a drug addict.

2380 6380594 1334
I really am.

2381 6382972 1751
Cocaine, pills,

2382 6385224 2418
whatever it is, I'll fucking do it.

2383 6388185 1709
Now that's the truth.

2384 6389979 1250
I mean...

2385 6391313 1376
I'm a sex addict, too.

2386 6393607 2419
Well, there are worse things
to be addicted to than sex.

2387 6397319 2377
Jesus, why am I telling you all this?
Why am I...

2388 6399780 1626
I'm sorry.

2389 6402158 2209
Because I'm very easy to talk to.

2390 6404744 2710
You are. You are easy to talk to.

2391 6408622 1418
I suppose it's...

2392 6410124 1417
Just my job, you know.

2393 6412793 1960
All these people dependent on me.

2394 6414837 2710
Tens of millions of dollars
at stake, you know.

2395 6417631 1709
Sometimes I feel like I...

2396 6419425 3169
I've bitten off more than
I can chew, you know.

2397 6422803 2293
You're a man with large appetites.

2398 6425264 1083
Yeah.

2399 6428059 1917
Is she fucking hitting on me?

2400 6430311 1041
Yeah.

2401 6431479 1292
Yeah, I am.

2402 6435149 3336
I suppose I put that
on myself though, right?

2403 6438819 1542
My decision.

2404 6440863 1459
It's just hard to...

2405 6442406 3920
Hard to learn to control
the anxiety sometimes, you know?

2406 6446911 1542
You know, to...

2407 6448662 2669
Learn to relax and let go and...

2408 6452333 2001
To release the tension.

2409 6455377 1459
She is hitting on me.

2410 6457797 1417
Holy shit!

2411 6459507 2251
Yeah, to release the tension.

2412 6465596 1751
I suppose we...

2413 6467890 2335
We all just need to learn...

2414 6470851 3294
Learn to do what
comes naturally in life, you know?

2415 6476065 2460
Is he fucking hitting on me?

2416 6484740 1667
Stability, dear.

2417 6486492 1417
Family.

2418 6494542 2167
You take care of my niece, my love.

2419 6496794 2543
I'll take care of everything over here.

2420 6500297 1084
Deal.

2421 6503926 2168
Come on! There you go.

2422 6508139 3252
We had, literally, a fuckload of money.

2423 6511892 2001
Aunt Emma could never
carry all this by herself.

2424 6514728 3670
So I thought to myself,
who else has a European passport?

2425 6518566 1917
Brad, you're making this
too fucking tight!

2426 6520568 2793
Now Brad, as a successful drug dealer,

2427 6523445 2210
spent his winters in the south of France,

2428 6525739 2043
which is where
he met his wife, Chantalle,

2429 6527867 2876
a stripper of Slovenian origin

2430 6530911 1417
born, in of all places,

2431 6532913 1501
Switzerland.

2432 6538586 1667
Well, this is fucked.

2433 6541297 1458
No shit.

2434 6546260 2460
Like, this will take her like 50 trips.

2435 6548804 1209
I know.

2436 6553726 1208
Let me ask you something?

2437 6555060 2585
What about her family? Right?

2438 6557730 2668
I mean, they all got
Swiss passports, right.

2439 6560482 1876
She's got parents,
she's got a brother, right?

2440 6562443 1917
The brother's got a wife.
That's five fucking people.

2441 6564445 1917
Six, seven trips, boom, right?

2442 6566447 1584
They're all fucking
Swiss nitwits like her.

2443 6568115 1250
- They'll do it.
- We could do that.

2444 6569450 2460
At least I have a family,
you crooked-nose fuck!

2445 6571994 2835
Hey, don't forget about my money.

2446 6576624 1083
I'm sorry, what's that?

2447 6577791 1459
Yeah, I forgot to tell you.
He's got some...

2448 6579335 2042
- He's got some money.
- My money.

2449 6581754 2209
I got a couple of mil
coming in like a week.

2450 6584048 2585
When it gets in, I'll give you a call,
you come pick it up.

2451 6589261 1417
You give me a call?

2452 6592306 3252
When it gets here, I'll give you a call
and you'll come pick it up.

2453 6595643 1792
Well, we don't fucking
work for you, man!

2454 6597978 2961
Sweetheart,
you have my money taped to your tits.

2455 6601023 2001
Okay? Technically, you do work for me.

2456 6606070 1584
Hey, Jordan, we're gonna need to talk.

2457 6607905 1500
If I fucking do this,
I'm telling you right now,

2458 6609490 958
I ain't going to him, okay.

2459 6610532 1042
- I'm not a fucking shvartze.
- I got it.

2460 6611659 1292
I don't do fucking pickups, all right?

2461 6613035 1042
- I got it.
- Well, listen to me.

2462 6614161 1584
We meet someplace that I fucking say.

2463 6615829 1376
And you tell that fucking piece of shit,

2464 6617289 1167
- he comes correct.
- I will.

2465 6618540 2293
He comes in all fucking loopy
and fucked up, I swear to God

2466 6620918 1834
I'll mash that douchebag's teeth in.

2467 6622836 1751
You're gonna mash
whose fucking teeth in?

2468 6624672 1709
Whose fucking teeth
are you gonna mash in?

2469 6626465 2293
I put the money on that
fucking table! Not you!

2470 6628842 1835
I'm the reason
we have this whole fucking deal!

2471 6630761 2001
- He's got a gun, you fucking idiot!
- Fuck his gun!

2472 6632846 1376
I put that money in there!

2473 6634306 1376
You know what?
You're a fucking pill dealer.

2474 6635766 2293
I got five more just like you, bro.

2475 6638143 1709
Keep talking, you fucking piece of shit!

2476 6639937 1751
You know what else?
You dress like shit!

2477 6641772 1000
So fuck you!

2478 6642856 1751
- Fucking motherfucker!
- Oh! Jesus!

2479 6644692 1834
How about that, faggot?
Who's a faggot?

2480 6646652 1792
You okay? Hey, pal.

2481 6651156 2794
The next day,
Aunt Emma flew to Geneva.

2482 6654034 2335
Two million in cash in her carry-on,

2483 6656453 2961
which in the big picture
was a drop in the Swiss bucket.

2484 6660666 1292
'Cause the following month,

2485 6662042 1876
over the course of six round trips,

2486 6664003 4044
Chantalle's family and friends
smuggled in over 20 million in cash

2487 6668132 1750
without even a hiccup.

2488 6674888 1918
- And I have some more.
- Really?

2489 6676890 1209
- Here.
- Oh, thank you.

2490 6678183 1126
And here.

2491 6679393 2001
- Welcome.
- Welcome.

2492 6681478 2252
Yeah, like four bags of it.

2493 6685357 2335
Are you Swiss-Slovakian
or Swiss-Slovenian?

2494 6687776 1543
- Slovenian.
- Slovenian?

2495 6689403 1208
Who cares. You're blonde.

2496 6690696 1000
Oh, stop.

2497 6712551 1125
Shit.

2498 6713761 1250
Just put the fucking car in park,

2499 6715095 1793
you dumb fucking idiot!

2500 6718432 1626
I can't close this briefcase.

2501 6720142 1375
One fucking day.

2502 6721602 1959
One fucking day,
you couldn't keep it together?

2503 6723645 1584
I'm fucked up, Brad.

2504 6725773 2626
- Gotta be fucking kidding me.
- Fucked up.

2505 6733238 1501
- It's a joke.
- It's a joke?

2506 6734823 1960
- I'm sober.
- Jesus fucking Christ!

2507 6736867 1000
It's a fucking joke.

2508 6737951 1584
- Are you fucking stupid?
- I'm not stupid.

2509 6739620 1459
You fucking drive in here
like a fucking maniac,

2510 6741163 1834
you know the attention that
that fucking draws?

2511 6743082 2668
- I'm not stupid. I'm smart.
- Smart?

2512 6745834 2085
- I make million-dollar deals.
- That right?

2513 6748003 2377
With smart important people,
unlike you.

2514 6750464 3878
People who don't sucker-punch people
when they're scared. Okay?

2515 6754426 1376
- I'm scared, huh?
- And by the way,

2516 6755886 1000
I haven't gotten an apology yet for that.

2517 6756970 1042
You want an apology, okay.

2518 6758097 1417
I check my fucking messages every day

2519 6759598 958
- when I come home from work.
- Did you?

2520 6760641 1250
- My answering machine. Zero.
- Didn't get one, huh?

2521 6761975 1042
I got a blinking light,

2522 6763102 1292
because I don't have shit from you.

2523 6764478 1208
You know what, you got
a big fucking mouth, okay?

2524 6765771 1250
I got my wife checking the messages

2525 6767106 2001
every 45 minutes
calling the office, saying,

2526 6769191 1209
"Has Brad apologized yet?

2527 6770484 2001
"Is there an apology message
on the machine?"

2528 6772569 1543
I don't have jack shit. You know what?

2529 6774196 1417
That's not how you treat people.

2530 6775697 1042
You got a big fucking mouth, you know.

2531 6776824 1667
I'm gonna give you a fucking pass.
Just give me the case.

2532 6778575 2210
You're gonna give me a pass?

2533 6780869 1584
Look, it's a figure of fucking speech.

2534 6782538 1959
Oh, my gosh. The Emperor of Fucksville

2535 6784581 1292
came down from Fucksville
to give me a pass!

2536 6785958 1000
From Fucksville, huh?

2537 6787042 1876
Hey, what are the citizens
of Fucksville doing today

2538 6789002 1459
when their Emperor's gone?

2539 6790546 1542
Is it mayhem?

2540 6792172 1793
Are people looting and raping?

2541 6794049 2001
What are all the little fuckheads
doing while you're here?

2542 6796135 1417
Go fuck yourself! Give me the bag.

2543 6797636 1292
You back the fuck up.

2544 6799012 3461
I'll cause the biggest fucking scene
that I've ever caused in my life

2545 6802558 1750
if you come at me again.

2546 6804393 1584
- You know what?
- Just fucking keep it down.

2547 6806061 1209
I got...

2548 6807354 4587
I don't wanna be out of line or anything,
but I think you like, like me. Like you...

2549 6812025 1459
Like when you come at me...

2550 6813569 1083
What's the matter with you?
What the fuck is...

2551 6814736 1418
...and you look at me.
I swear I just noticed it.

2552 6816238 1709
You have like a fucking, like...

2553 6818031 2001
Like a twinkle. You have like a twinkle.

2554 6820117 1459
Are you trying to kiss me, bro?

2555 6821660 1584
Jesus fucking Christ.

2556 6823328 1960
- What's with you?
- I have a... I don't know.

2557 6825372 1709
- It's not a homophobic thing.
- All right...

2558 6827166 1709
You're just not the one for me, pal.

2559 6828959 1125
You know what I mean? It's not...

2560 6830169 1917
- It's not about that for me, you know.
- I've heard enough.

2561 6832171 2418
Please, I'm begging,
give me the fucking case.

2562 6834673 1375
- I'm gonna give you the case.
- Give me the case.

2563 6836133 1375
- You gotta do me one favor.
- What's that?

2564 6837593 3294
You gotta take this case,
you gotta drive straight home,

2565 6840971 3503
need you to open up the briefcase,
and you take out every single dollar.

2566 6844558 1959
Don't leave one dollar
inside the briefcase.

2567 6846602 1125
And once you have it all

2568 6847811 1793
neatly organized outside the briefcase,

2569 6849688 2293
I need you to take it
and I need you to shove it right up

2570 6852065 2085
your wife's Latvian cunt,
you understand?

2571 6854234 1668
- My fucking wife!
- Chill! Chill, bro.

2572 6855986 1459
Fuck. You motherfucking piece of shit!

2573 6857529 1042
How about now?

2574 6858739 1375
- Go, go!
- Fuck!

2575 6861867 1709
Motherfuck! You're fucking dead!

2576 6863660 1668
Stop! Don't move! Don't move!

2577 6865412 2835
Stop, or I will blow you the fuck away!

2578 6868665 2168
Drop the case!
Put your hands in the air!

2579 6870918 1125
Get down.

2580 6872836 1751
Get down on your knees!
Get down on your knees!

2581 6875297 4503
Motherfucker!

2582 6888977 3211
Jordan, do I have a surprise for you!

2583 6892439 2585
- What's that?
- Twenty real Lemmons.

2584 6895108 1167
Retired pharmacist's client of mine,

2585 6896360 1167
they've been in the safe for 15 years.

2586 6897611 1459
Are you fucking kidding me? Lemmons?

2587 6900322 1876
They're gonna knock us
on our fucking heads.

2588 6902282 4921
When it comes to Quaaludes,
the Lemmon 714 was the Holy Grail.

2589 6907287 1501
- Can you believe it?
- Oh, my God.

2590 6908872 1459
I thought they were like a myth.

2591 6910415 1876
Three times as powerful
as anything available today.

2592 6912376 1041
Look at these babies.

2593 6913502 2585
Boy, Donnie really knew
how to celebrate.

2594 6916171 2085
He said he was saving these
for a special occasion.

2595 6918340 2585
Like a birthday, or being clap free,

2596 6921009 2961
or our money arriving
safely in Switzerland.

2597 6927391 1250
So that night,

2598 6928725 1835
I cleared my schedule and I rid my body

2599 6930644 2501
of anything that could fuck with my high.

2600 6933855 1793
It was celebration time.

2601 6936233 1167
Okay.

2602 6937484 1501
Start off with one, see how it goes?

2603 6939069 1751
My guy says all we'll need is one.

2604 6940904 1417
Here you go.

2605 6943031 1668
- Salud!
- Cheers.

2606 6944783 2794
Maybe if I pull it again, it'll go down.

2607 6949329 1251
Steve! Steve!

2608 6950664 1250
I gotta get out of here!

2609 6951999 1875
Carl, I think I got it figured out.

2610 6953959 3711
It must be one pull for up
and two pulls for down.

2611 6957754 1251
Okay.

2612 6967347 1793
Do you feel anything?

2613 6971810 1167
No.

2614 6975689 1834
It's been 35 minutes.

2615 6980027 3544
Maybe we've built up a tolerance
after all these years, huh?

2616 6996710 1417
This is bullshit!

2617 6998211 3169
My metabolism's pumping.
I can't feel shit!

2618 7001465 1167
They're old.

2619 7002716 2168
You think they lost their potency, huh?

2620 7004968 1626
Check the bottle!

2621 7009431 1417
January '81.

2622 7010932 1084
They're fucking duds.

2623 7012100 1042
Fuck!

2624 7013226 1084
Let's take...

2625 7014394 1501
Let's take two more each.

2626 7017856 2543
- Jordan.
- Yeah, baby.

2627 7024071 1709
What are you two retards doing?

2628 7025864 1083
We're working out, honey.

2629 7027407 1584
Well, Bo Dietl's on the phone.

2630 7029076 1000
Okay.

2631 7030160 1918
- Okay?
- Okay.

2632 7033580 1542
Hey, Bo, what's going on?

2633 7035207 1125
Jordan, listen to me clearly.

2634 7036416 2585
I cannot talk to you on this phone,
I have to talk to you.

2635 7039086 1500
Get out of here. What's going on?

2636 7040671 3335
Listen to me!
Leave the fucking house, Jordan,

2637 7044091 1667
and then call me from a pay phone.

2638 7045842 1960
This is not a fucking joke, Jordan.

2639 7047886 1626
Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

2640 7050013 1334
- Shit.
- What'd he say?

2641 7051431 1376
I don't know what the fuck's going on.

2642 7052891 1959
- I gotta go!
- Is everything okay, Jordan?

2643 7065278 1751
The closest pay phone I could get to

2644 7067114 2293
was at the Brookville Country Club.

2645 7070075 1959
It was a real WASP stronghold,

2646 7072119 2585
just a mile down the road
from my house.

2647 7084172 1417
Hey, Bo, what's up, it's me.
What's going on?

2648 7085674 1042
I'm at a pay phone. What's going on?

2649 7086800 1125
Listen to me carefully.

2650 7088009 3753
Please. Your little friend there, Brad,
your little buddy, he's in jail.

2651 7092431 1292
What the fuck's he in jail for?

2652 7093807 1459
- What'd he do?
- I don't know what he did.

2653 7095350 1334
My friends in Long Island told me

2654 7096768 2210
he got picked up
in some fucking shopping mall.

2655 7099062 1000
He got locked up by...

2656 7100147 2251
Wait, wait. Did you...
Did you say a shopping mall?

2657 7102482 1292
- Yeah.
- He was with Donnie.

2658 7103859 1375
He was supposed
to deliver some money,

2659 7105318 1543
- then that fucking fat piece of shit...
- Listen to me!

2660 7106945 1000
I gotta go fucking talk to him right now!

2661 7108029 1918
Listen to me! Don't go! Listen to me.

2662 7110031 2627
That guy Denham, that FBI agent guy,

2663 7112743 2292
somebody told me
he's got your phones tapped.

2664 7115120 1500
Your office and your home.

2665 7116705 1709
Don't talk on the motherfucking phone!

2666 7118498 1918
Okay. Fuck! I got it. I got it. I got it.

2667 7120876 1125
Jordan.

2668 7122544 3794
You didn't try to bribe
this fucking FBI agent, did you?

2669 7126423 2043
No, I didn't try to bribe an FBI agent.

2670 7128550 1542
You think I'm that fucking stupid? No.

2671 7130177 1875
What the fuck did you say?
I can't understand you.

2672 7132137 1167
Say that again.

2673 7133388 2794
I said...

2674 7136850 1918
What the fuck are you saying?

2675 7139352 1000
I said...

2676 7140437 1459
Are you fucking high?

2677 7144524 2627
Jordan, are you fucking high?

2678 7147986 2126
Jordan, do me a favor,
stay where you are.

2679 7150197 1625
Don't get behind the wheel of the car.

2680 7151907 1542
I'm gonna send Rocco over
to pick you up.

2681 7153533 1251
Jordan! Jordan!

2682 7154868 2251
After 15 years in storage,

2683 7157204 2960
the Lemmons had
developed a delayed fuse.

2684 7160248 2669
It took 90 minutes for
these little fuckers to kick in.

2685 7163001 1375
But once they did...

2686 7165921 1542
I mean, I had skipped the tingle phase

2687 7167547 1918
and went straight to the drool phase.

2688 7169549 1960
Tell me where you are!
Don't fucking drive...

2689 7171593 1918
These little bastards were so strong,

2690 7173595 2043
I discovered a whole new phase.

2691 7175722 2043
The cerebral palsy phase.

2692 7180060 2001
Come on, stand up!

2693 7186024 1918
Okay, walking's out.

2694 7188902 2877
All right, think, think.
What else is there?

2695 7192614 3711
Yes! I can crawl. I can crawl like Skylar!

2696 7227983 2960
Fuck! The kid makes it look
so goddamn easy!

2697 7237993 2376
Think, you motherfucker, think!

2698 7240453 1334
Yes!

2699 7241872 2084
I got it! I've got it!

2700 7244374 2168
I can roll! I can roll!

2701 7328875 4170
Jordan.

2702 7333421 1668
Oh, Jesus. Where are you?

2703 7335173 1459
I'm at a country club!

2704 7336716 1042
What?

2705 7337842 2836
I'm at a country club!

2706 7340762 1334
I don't know what
the fuck you're saying.

2707 7342180 1250
Look, you need to get home.

2708 7343515 2626
Donnie is out of control!
He's on the other line

2709 7346226 1876
with some Swiss guy. I don't know...

2710 7348186 1000
What?

2711 7349270 2961
Get him off the phone!

2712 7352565 2752
I can't understand you!

2713 7355402 1250
Get him

2714 7356736 1042
off

2715 7357862 1126
the phone!

2716 7359072 1250
I don't know what the fuck
you're saying, Jordan.

2717 7360407 1333
Can you just get home? Hurry!

2718 7371584 2127
I was less than a mile from home.

2719 7373795 2710
I drove as slow as I fucking could.

2720 7376589 2001
I'd seen Jell-O move faster.

2721 7378675 2418
I was gonna give you two million.

2722 7381261 2543
I's gonna be lates.

2723 7384472 1584
You ate two million?

2724 7386975 1250
Later.

2725 7388309 1126
Get off the phone.

2726 7389519 1501
Get off the fucking phone! Idiot!

2727 7392397 2084
Get out of the way, asshole!

2728 7397152 1250
You hate two million?

2729 7398486 1501
No, you don't hate two million, Donnie.

2730 7402532 2877
By some miracle, I made it home alive,

2731 7405493 2293
not a scratch on me or the car.

2732 7417213 1084
Jordan?

2733 7418798 2585
Jesus fucking Christ!

2734 7421468 1500
What did you take?

2735 7423053 1291
What's wrong with you?

2736 7424429 1000
Jor!

2737 7425513 2377
It's fucking good, right?

2738 7427974 1334
Fucked up!

2739 7430643 1835
Get off the phone!

2740 7435523 2210
What the fuck, Jordan?

2741 7437817 1584
Your daughter's in the house!

2742 7439486 1083
I hope you know that!

2743 7440653 1334
Your fucking daughter's in the house!

2744 7442489 1333
Yeah, it's real fucking funny, Donnie.

2745 7444032 2418
Get off the phone!

2746 7447619 958
Jesus Christ, Jordan.

2747 7448661 1668
The FBI!

2748 7451664 1251
Hey!

2749 7453458 1876
I'm on phone!

2750 7455543 2377
Get off the fucking phone!

2751 7459672 2001
- Come here!
...the phone.

2752 7463760 3127
Come on. We're gonna
go upstairs, all right.

2753 7471768 1500
I'm on the phone!

2754 7473353 1333
On the phone!

2755 7474771 2084
I know what you did,

2756 7477357 1417
you piece of shit!

2757 7478858 1709
What? What?

2758 7480652 6213
Brad!

2759 7486950 2418
You fucking cocksucker!

2760 7493706 1876
What did you do,

2761 7495667 1792
you piece of shit?

2762 7497544 1417
Fuck you!

2763 7500213 4545
I wanna fucking kill you!

2764 7505718 1334
I got you!

2765 7531619 1918
What the fuck happened?

2766 7533997 1250
Oh, shit!

2767 7535331 1876
Jordan? Jordan, are you all right?

2768 7537375 1584
Donnie? Donnie?

2769 7539294 1083
Donnie?

2770 7540461 1334
Jordan, he's not breathing.

2771 7541880 1792
Oh, fuck, I don't know what to do.

2772 7543756 1251
Jordan, I don't know what the fuck to do!

2773 7545091 1334
I can't help him! Oh, my God. Jordan.

2774 7548469 2544
Oh, my God, I think he's choking,
Jordan. Do something.

2775 7551097 1751
- Oh, God.
- Baby, I got you!

2776 7553433 2877
He's not breathing, Jordan.
You gotta do something!

2777 7557228 2293
Shit! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

2778 7561441 1333
I got you.

2779 7582128 1584
Step aside!

2780 7583963 3294
Oh, God!

2781 7587634 1750
Move aside, baby.

2782 7596351 1792
Come on! Come on!

2783 7598228 1208
Come on!

2784 7603983 2669
Jordan, he's not breathing.
You gotta do something.

2785 7607695 2043
Jordan, he's a father!
He's got fucking kids!

2786 7609822 1668
- Do something!
- Yeah?

2787 7617163 1084
Rocco, you gotta get over here.

2788 7618331 1918
- Come on.
- Call an ambulance!

2789 7620333 1167
I don't fucking know!

2790 7621584 1751
Just get over here! Call 911.

2791 7631386 1000
Yeah.

2792 7633930 2335
You all right? He's all right.

2793 7649445 4504
Mr. Belfort?

2794 7656619 2919
Get the fuck out of here. Fuck.

2795 7659622 2502
Sir, we need to ask you some questions.

2796 7662792 1959
Are you fucking kidding me? Fuck you.

2797 7664836 1125
Come on, get up.

2798 7666045 1542
Get the fuck out of my house.

2799 7669382 1709
- Let's go.
- I've been here all night.

2800 7671175 1501
I been sitting here all night.

2801 7672760 1376
What the fuck are you talking about?

2802 7674220 1959
- Where you taking him?
- Where you taking me?

2803 7676264 1083
Where you taking him?

2804 7677432 1041
You ain't got no warrant.

2805 7678558 1292
Just come up
in people's house like that!

2806 7681019 2293
Did you drive your car tonight,
Mr. Belfort?

2807 7684897 1042
Well?

2808 7689235 1375
Wow!

2809 7690903 1793
Maybe I hadn't made it home okay.

2810 7707837 2376
Get out of the fucking way!

2811 7712175 1250
Fuck!

2812 7719057 3627
Did you drive that car tonight?

2813 7723811 2126
- Yeah.
- Yeah, right.

2814 7726022 1792
I'm a family man!

2815 7727899 1750
Family man. Honey!

2816 7729734 1959
It was a miracle I wasn't killed,

2817 7731778 3002
or that I didn't kill anybody else.

2818 7734864 3169
The cops took me in for questioning,
but they couldn't charge me.

2819 7738117 2418
They had no proof
I was even behind the wheel.

2820 7740620 1083
Meanwhile,

2821 7741788 2084
Brad did three months
in jail for contempt

2822 7743956 2585
because he wouldn't rat Donnie out.

2823 7746626 2710
The result, I was scot-free.

2824 7749420 2377
But I had eyes on me like never before.

2825 7751881 1667
You're a lucky man, Jordan.

2826 7753633 2918
You're lucky to be alive,
let alone not in jail.

2827 7756636 1584
You know I don't believe in luck, right?

2828 7758304 1334
But it's time.

2829 7759722 2251
Please, let me call the SEC
and cut a deal

2830 7762058 1917
before your luck runs out.

2831 7764060 1584
Wave to Daddy.

2832 7765728 1084
Hey.

2833 7766896 1501
Hey, sweetie.

2834 7773611 3294
What kind of terms
would you be talking about if I...

2835 7776989 1209
I don't know.

2836 7778282 2961
You plead guilty to a handful
of securities violations,

2837 7781327 3044
stock manipulation,
high-pressure sales tactics.

2838 7784455 2794
Ticky-tack shit like that, you know.

2839 7787333 1959
You pay a couple
million dollars in fines,

2840 7789377 2960
in exchange, the SEC
fucks off till the end of time.

2841 7794674 1625
And Stratton?

2842 7796801 1876
What happens to Stratton?

2843 7798761 2835
There's no way... I mean...
You got to walk away. Right?

2844 7801681 1125
Let Donnie be in charge.

2845 7802890 1626
Right. Donnie.

2846 7805226 2168
Now the FBI is
another animal completely.

2847 7807478 1793
They'll still be pursuing you
for criminal wrongdoing.

2848 7809355 2752
However, with you
stepping down voluntarily,

2849 7812191 1918
my guess is that
your best friend Agent Denham

2850 7814193 2335
will be standing around
with his dick in his hand.

2851 7817655 1292
Jordan.

2852 7819031 1918
What do you have to think about?

2853 7821033 1584
You beat them.

2854 7822702 1125
You won!

2855 7823911 1626
God knows you never
have to work again.

2856 7825621 2001
What're you gonna do?
Spend the rest of your life in jail?

2857 7827707 1083
- Is that what you want?
- No.

2858 7828875 1041
- Of course not.
- Okay.

2859 7830001 2042
Okay! You got
all the money in the world.

2860 7832128 1584
You need everybody else's money?

2861 7833796 1417
- Of course not, Pops.
- Well?

2862 7835298 2334
- You know, I built it.
- I know you built it.

2863 7837717 1709
You built it, so now preserve it.

2864 7870666 1417
You know,

2865 7872460 2710
five years ago,
when I started Stratton Oakmont

2866 7875254 2085
with Donnie Azoff, I knew the day

2867 7877423 3294
would eventually come
where I'd have to be moving on.

2868 7882678 3795
And it's truly with a heavy heart
that I'm here to say that...

2869 7888100 2168
That that day is finally here.

2870 7894482 2293
I wanna... I want
to thank you all for your...

2871 7896859 2669
Your years of loyalty and admiration.

2872 7899612 1459
But the point is this.

2873 7902031 1250
Under Donnie's leadership,

2874 7903366 3460
along with Nicky Koskoff
and Robbie Feinberg

2875 7906911 2793
moving into key management positions,
this place really

2876 7909789 1333
is gonna be better than ever!

2877 7911207 2126
That I promise you. Okay?

2878 7913709 2502
Give them a round of applause.
Come on.

2879 7919298 2752
This is Ellis Island here, people.

2880 7922134 1668
I don't care who you are,
where you're from,

2881 7923886 2502
whether your relatives
came over on the fucking Mayflower

2882 7926472 2168
or on an inner tube from Haiti,

2883 7928724 2252
this right here is the land of opportunity.

2884 7931060 2502
Stratton Oakmont is America!

2885 7937608 1626
All of you know Kimmie Belzer, right?

2886 7939318 1209
Yes, we do.

2887 7940611 1125
Fuck you.

2888 7942405 1208
Come on, Kimmie.

2889 7943698 1542
What you probably didn't know is,

2890 7945324 1793
Kimmie was one of
the first brokers here,

2891 7947201 2293
one of Stratton's original 20.

2892 7950246 1834
Now most of you met Kimmie,

2893 7952164 3002
the beautiful sophisticated woman
that she is today.

2894 7955585 3085
A woman that wears
$3,000 Armani suits.

2895 7960673 2543
Who drives a brand-new
Mercedes-Benz.

2896 7963926 1834
A woman who spends

2897 7965845 1417
her winters in the Bahamas

2898 7967346 2126
and summers in the Hamptons!

2899 7974478 2335
That's not the Kimmie that I met.

2900 7979650 3753
The Kimmie that I met
didn't have two nickels to rub together.

2901 7984655 2251
She was a single mom
on the balls of her ass

2902 7986991 1792
with an eight-year-old son.

2903 7988868 3002
Okay? She was
three months behind on her rent.

2904 7992955 3670
And when she came to me
and asked me for a job,

2905 7996709 2209
she asked for a $5,000 advance

2906 7999003 3169
just so she could pay her son's tuition.

2907 8006636 1709
And what'd I do, Kimmie?

2908 8008429 1709
Go on, tell them.

2909 8011891 2042
You wrote me a check

2910 8014185 2084
for $25,000.

2911 8017563 1459
That's right.

2912 8019148 1334
Thank you.

2913 8023903 1751
And you know why that is?

2914 8028991 2293
It's because I believed in you.

2915 8032995 2710
It's because I believed in you, Kimmie,

2916 8036123 3878
just like I believe in each
and every one of you here today.

2917 8040086 2418
- I fucking love you, Jordan!
- I fucking love you.

2918 8042588 1793
I fucking love you! I love you.

2919 8044465 2793
I fucking love you, too!
I fucking love you, too!

2920 8050179 2001
And I love all of you!

2921 8052765 2335
And I love all of you
from the bottom of my heart.

2922 8055184 2460
- I fucking love you, too.
- I mean that.

2923 8058479 2293
You are the shit.
You are the fucking shit.

2924 8067279 2168
It's a shame, you know.

2925 8071033 4128
For years, I've been telling you guys
never to take no for an answer, right?

2926 8075246 3210
You know, to keep pushing,
to never hang up the phone

2927 8079375 2251
until you get what you want.

2928 8082503 1751
Because you all deserve it.

2929 8086298 3169
You know, this fucking deal
that I'm about to sign

2930 8089969 2126
barring me from the securities industry,

2931 8092179 2043
barring me from Stratton,

2932 8095307 1418
my home.

2933 8099478 2001
What the fuck is that, you know?

2934 8102690 2334
I'll tell you what it is. It's...

2935 8105776 2794
It's me taking no
for an answer, you know.

2936 8110072 1250
It's them...

2937 8111407 3252
It's them selling me,
not the other way around.

2938 8115411 2710
It's me being a hypocrite is what it is.

2939 8123294 1250
So...

2940 8131677 1542
You know what?

2941 8137016 5212
I'm not leaving.

2942 8145191 1166
I'm not fucking leaving!

2943 8151405 2418
You're not getting a fucking promotion!

2944 8155201 1333
The show goes on!

2945 8159163 1417
This is my home!

2946 8160664 2752
They're gonna need
a fucking wrecking ball

2947 8163501 1875
to take me out of here!

2948 8167379 2502
They're gonna need to
send in the National Guard

2949 8169965 1751
or fucking SWAT team

2950 8171801 2501
'cause I ain't going nowhere!

2951 8177139 5254
Fuck them!

2952 8216512 1792
Jordy! Jordy!

2953 8218430 2001
Jordy! Get back here!

2954 8221267 1166
Hey!

2955 8224895 1250
Give me that.

2956 8228649 1125
What is this?

2957 8229859 2501
Ramar of the Jungle, for Christ sake?

2958 8233445 2919
Paddy D, mazel tov, you Irishman.

2959 8236448 3461
Jordan Belfort just welched
on his deal with the SEC.

2960 8239994 2668
He is back in the ocean. Happy hunting.

2961 8255593 2293
It was our time to party big.

2962 8257970 2627
And just as Brad
was released from jail, too.

2963 8261432 3961
I apologized, even offered to
pay him for his time in the can.

2964 8265978 2084
But he said no, that he was out.

2965 8268147 1876
He didn't want any part of us.

2966 8270107 1626
Sad thing was,

2967 8271817 3211
two years later he was dead.

2968 8275195 2419
Massive heart attack. Thirty-five.

2969 8278407 2335
Same age Mozart died.

2970 8280826 3252
Not that they have a hell
of a lot in common, but...

2971 8284163 2334
Anyway, I don't know
why that came to mind.

2972 8288667 3586
Within days, subpoenas started flying.

2973 8292338 3335
Notices to produce documents,
depositions, you name it.

2974 8295758 2001
Donnie couldn't drink water fast enough.

2975 8297843 2460
United States government
wants to give me a subpoena?

2976 8300387 3294
Here's what we do
with subpoenas at Stratton Oakmont!

2977 8309438 2627
Fuck you, USA! Fuck you!

2978 8312149 1876
Fuck you! Fuck you!

2979 8314109 1793
Fuck you!

2980 8323661 2042
Jordan Belfort.

2981 8325788 1876
Alden. That's a nice name.

2982 8327748 1292
Thank you very much for that.

2983 8329124 2168
- What kind of name is that?
- That is my name.

2984 8331377 1667
I do not recall that.

2985 8333128 2335
I do not recall that. Okay?

2986 8335547 2168
Mr. Ming, thank you for coming in today.

2987 8337800 1625
Are you gonna finish
the rest of that Danish?

2988 8339510 1208
- Can I have that Danish?
- No, no, go ahead.

2989 8340803 1667
They interrogated everybody.

2990 8342554 1626
I got a low blood sugar, thyroid thing.

2991 8344264 1167
It went on for months.

2992 8345516 2042
It was a total fucking harassment.

2993 8347643 1542
Tell him to proceed with the questions.

2994 8349269 2460
But not a single Strattonite cracked.

2995 8351814 1667
Gladys Carrera?

2996 8353565 1543
Doesn't ring a bell.

2997 8355192 2627
Sorry, I have
no recommendation of that.

2998 8357987 1000
No.

2999 8359071 1000
No idea.

3000 8360155 2502
I don't recall that transaction.
You guys have any milk?

3001 8362741 2252
Absolutely not.

3002 8365077 1834
Francis Sortigi
you called so many times

3003 8366996 2209
I just thought you might remember that.

3004 8369289 1501
Would you remember any of those?

3005 8370874 1751
- I do not recall any of that.
- This Abdul...

3006 8372710 2167
I do not... No, I don't recall.

3007 8374962 1667
It was a long phone call.

3008 8376714 1667
I just wondered if you have
any memory of that.

3009 8378465 3169
Okay. You know we've talked to
several of the employees at this firm

3010 8381719 3294
and nobody can recall anything
about this Steve Madden IPO.

3011 8385097 1250
I think it's odd.

3012 8388225 2502
Do you recall Cartage Corporation?

3013 8392229 1250
You do recall it?

3014 8393564 1292
No, I don't recall that at all.

3015 8395441 2918
Excuse me. I have to ask.
Is that your real hair?

3016 8398986 2126
Are you gonna say anything about that?

3017 8401196 1292
Are you gonna comment on my hair?

3018 8402573 1709
Is that how we're doing...
Is this personal questions?

3019 8404366 1668
I'm just wondering why you would
wear something like that.

3020 8406118 1834
Sorry. I don't recall that company.

3021 8410039 1750
Can I get you anything else, gentlemen?

3022 8411874 1834
Yes. Sweetheart, I have a rare condition

3023 8413792 3419
which requires me to drink one of those
every 15 minutes, please.

3024 8417671 3127
We were specifically advised
not to leave the country.

3025 8420883 2042
So, we took our wives to Italy.

3026 8423302 2418
We figured we were safer
working from overseas

3027 8425804 1376
giving orders to Rugrat.

3028 8427264 2168
Nobody could arrest us
and nobody could prove

3029 8429516 2001
I was still running Stratton from a yacht.

3030 8431602 1250
Hey, Rugrat.

3031 8432936 1167
Bonjour.

3032 8434188 2001
You bald-headed eagle, how you doing?

3033 8436273 958
Donnie, Donnie, listen!

3034 8437316 1292
We have a problem, okay.

3035 8438692 3252
Your friend, Steve Madden,
is unloading shares.

3036 8442029 2043
What are you saying?
Who told you that?

3037 8444156 1584
- What's going on?
- He's doing it, Donnie!

3038 8445824 2460
He said that
Steve Madden's unloading shares.

3039 8448368 1126
Who told you that? It's bullshit!

3040 8449578 2335
Give me that goddamn phone.

3041 8451997 1542
What's going on?

3042 8453749 2084
Jordan, look. I'm watching the screen

3043 8455918 2710
and huge chunks of Steve Madden
are being sold, okay.

3044 8458712 2043
It's not coming from us,
so it's gotta be Steve.

3045 8460839 2043
He's the only person
with that many shares.

3046 8462966 959
It's Donnie. Call me back, all right.

3047 8464009 2335
Donnie, your little friend
is trying to fuck me, you know that.

3048 8466470 1709
Your little friend is trying to
fuck me right in the ass.

3049 8468263 1584
- Get him on the phone now!
- We don't know anything yet.

3050 8469932 1375
Let's not jump to conclusions.

3051 8471809 1709
Even though I owned 85%

3052 8473602 3044
of Steve-cocksucking-
motherfucking-Madden Shoes,

3053 8476730 2251
the shares were in his fucking name.

3054 8479066 2209
This motherfucker knew
I was in trouble with the feds

3055 8481360 1792
and was trying to take advantage.

3056 8483237 1500
Talk to me, man.
How do you wanna play this?

3057 8484822 1750
I want you to get
all our clients on the phone right now

3058 8486657 1292
and have them start
selling Steve Madden.

3059 8488033 1459
We're gonna drive
that fucking price down!

3060 8489576 1501
Do you hear me? Shut the fuck up!

3061 8491203 1626
This is your fucking friend
from high school.

3062 8492996 2085
If that little fucking prick
thinks he can fuck with me,

3063 8495165 2585
we'll turn his company
into a penny stock! You hear me?

3064 8497835 1417
- You got it?
- Yes. I got it!

3065 8499336 2919
Let's just not jump to conclusions
before we know what's going on.

3066 8502339 2543
Captain Ted!

3067 8505384 2376
Hang up your phones! Everybody, hey!

3068 8507845 2751
Turn the boat around!
We're going home!

3069 8513725 2377
Baby! Baby, what happened?

3070 8516395 1250
I just...

3071 8518063 1250
Sweetheart, what's going on?

3072 8520440 1626
Aunt Emma...

3073 8522943 1292
Just wait.

3074 8524653 1626
I can't...

3075 8526363 2877
What's going on? Why you crying?

3076 8529324 2043
- She's dead!
- Who? Who's dead?

3077 8531451 2377
I just got a call from my cousin Betty.

3078 8533912 1084
Yeah?

3079 8535080 1709
Aunt Emma is dead.

3080 8538208 2710
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- No.

3081 8541253 1167
You're serious?

3082 8543213 2293
Oh, my God! Baby, that's...

3083 8545591 1458
Oh, fuck!

3084 8547134 1792
Oh, sweetheart, that's just...

3085 8549011 1333
Fucking heart attack!

3086 8550429 1584
Boom, snap, gone.

3087 8552097 1834
Shuffled off her mortal coil.

3088 8554016 3335
And $20 million stuck
in a Swiss bank account.

3089 8557436 2084
The last time I talked
to her she was fine!

3090 8559605 2167
- She's not that old.
- Oh, God! Baby, oh, God!

3091 8561857 2168
That's so fucking terrible!

3092 8564109 1709
Oh, fuck!

3093 8565903 1000
It is terrible.

3094 8566987 2543
Your aunt was such an elegant,
attractive woman.

3095 8569615 1917
My condolences to you and your family.

3096 8571617 1333
Yes. We're absolutely devastated.

3097 8573035 2001
Thank you so much
for your condolences.

3098 8575120 2919
Now where does that leave us
in regard to her account exactly?

3099 8578123 1501
Does it go into probate or what?

3100 8579708 1584
Not to worry, Jordan. Not to worry.

3101 8581376 1668
Your aunt, before she died,

3102 8583128 2919
signed a document
naming you as her successor.

3103 8586298 1500
She did?

3104 8587883 1625
Fantastic! Well, that's good news!

3105 8589801 2168
Well, not as of yet.

3106 8592304 2001
What does that mean? Not as of yet?

3107 8596725 1709
I can't seem to hear you.

3108 8598518 2711
I must have bad reception.
Are you speaking English?

3109 8601396 2669
- Very... Now. Fast. Very fast.
- Fast?

3110 8604149 2126
I have to get to Switzerland now?

3111 8607986 2085
Speak English! Fucking speak English!

3112 8610155 1292
Whoa! Hey, hey, hey. Hey! Quiet, okay?

3113 8611531 1459
Take your suit, take your dick, okay,

3114 8613075 1709
- and move your ass! Please.
- Okay.

3115 8615827 1042
Move my ass! Yes!

3116 8616954 4128
I gotta say, these Swiss were
some sneaky motherfuckers.

3117 8621166 1918
Within minutes,
he had me set up with a forger

3118 8623168 2001
who could fake Aunt Emma's signature.

3119 8625254 1542
You American shit!

3120 8626964 3377
I just had to get there by tomorrow,
or lose $20 million.

3121 8630425 1709
We're going to Monaco!

3122 8632678 2293
- Monaco? Now?
- Yes, baby.

3123 8635055 2585
We're going to Monaco,
so then we can go to Switzerland, okay?

3124 8637724 1709
- But her aunt just died.
- I realize that.

3125 8639518 2918
But I have business in Switzerland.
I need to go to Switzerland right now.

3126 8642521 2084
Bottom line. Sorry.

3127 8644898 1793
We gotta get to London.

3128 8647192 1250
Why? Why?

3129 8649945 1167
The funeral!

3130 8651196 1334
Yeah, but, babe. Look, look...

3131 8653031 2752
I loved your aunt
more than anyone in the entire world.

3132 8655867 1501
I really did.

3133 8657869 2252
But she's dead now, sweetie.

3134 8660205 2210
She's dead
and she's not going anywhere.

3135 8662499 2376
She'll still be dead by the time
we get to London, okay?

3136 8665544 1751
Captain Ted!
Captain Ted, all right, look.

3137 8667379 1792
We're going to Monaco.
Monaco now, okay?

3138 8669256 1042
Monaco, right.

3139 8670382 1876
We're going to Monaco
so that we can drive to Switzerland

3140 8672342 1292
so they don't stamp our passports.

3141 8673719 1875
Take care of business here,
we'll drive back to Monaco,

3142 8675679 1667
take a flight over to London
to catch the funeral

3143 8677431 1500
and be in New York
in three fucking business days!

3144 8679016 1166
That's the fucking plan.

3145 8680267 2376
I just want you to know that
we might run into some chop.

3146 8682728 2209
Chop? We can fucking
handle chop, right?

3147 8685022 1417
I mean, it's a 170-foot yacht.

3148 8686523 2752
No, no, no. We're not going anywhere
unless he says it's safe, all right.

3149 8689359 1417
- Don't worry about the chop.
- It's safe.

3150 8690861 1333
You don't know shit about chop.

3151 8692279 2209
Oh, really? And you do?
You're a fucking expert on that.

3152 8694573 2334
I'll chop your fucking credit card in half.
How about that?

3153 8696992 1876
Chop is fine. Trust me. Chop is fine.

3154 8698952 1709
Is chop fine, Captain Ted?

3155 8701997 1834
Yeah. I mean, if we take it slow.

3156 8703915 1167
Yeah, we're gonna take it slow.

3157 8705167 1584
It's a little uncomfortable.
Tell them it's safe.

3158 8706835 1167
It's gonna be safe.

3159 8708086 3586
We'll batten down the hatches
and secure the deck.

3160 8711757 3711
And we're looking at a few...
Maybe a few broken dishes.

3161 8715552 1125
Few broken dishes.

3162 8716762 1208
What's a few broken dishes?

3163 8718055 1292
Does that sound fucking awesome
or what?

3164 8719431 1375
No. Not really.

3165 8720891 1292
We're gonna have a fucking good time!

3166 8722267 1751
Let's go to fucking Monaco now!

3167 8724102 1167
Let's fucking move! Let's go!

3168 8730692 1042
Hold on!

3169 8734905 3002
What the fuck is going on out here?

3170 8737991 2627
The Jet Skis just went overboard!

3171 8740702 2001
Oh, Jesus Christ! Honey, you okay?

3172 8742788 2126
Gale warning! Gale warning!

3173 8744998 2794
The waves are
20 feet high and building!

3174 8747876 1667
Turn around, let's go
the other fucking way.

3175 8749628 1208
- We can't!
- Go!

3176 8750921 2585
We'll get broad-sided. It'll tip over!

3177 8753590 1793
I am a master diver. You hear that?

3178 8755467 1042
I'm a master diver!

3179 8756593 1250
No one's gonna fucking die!

3180 8757928 2626
I got you, baby. I got you.
Trust me, okay?

3181 8760639 1250
I love you.

3182 8761973 1918
I love you, baby. Just hold on tight.

3183 8763975 1042
Okay.

3184 8765102 1041
Donnie!

3185 8767729 1209
Hold on, baby!

3186 8769022 4087
Donnie!

3187 8773610 1375
- What?
- Hold on, baby.

3188 8775070 1500
Get the fucking ludes.

3189 8776655 1167
I don't wanna die, Jordan!

3190 8777906 2710
I did a lot of bad shit.
I'm going to hell, Jordan!

3191 8780700 2877
I fucked up! I fucked up so bad!

3192 8783662 2001
Get the ludes! Downstairs!

3193 8785872 1209
What are you saying?

3194 8787582 1417
Fuck!

3195 8789876 1209
Get the ludes!

3196 8791169 1584
I can't go down there, Jordan.
It's flooded.

3197 8792838 1250
It's three feet of water down there!

3198 8794172 2752
I will not die sober!

3199 8797008 1751
Get those fucking ludes!

3200 8798844 1041
Okay!

3201 8799970 1333
- Go!
- Okay.

3202 8804182 1751
- Where's he going?
- Hold on, baby!

3203 8806017 1584
Donnie! Is he fucking crazy?

3204 8807686 1125
He's just warning everybody!

3205 8821032 1709
Jesus Christ!

3206 8824327 1167
Hold on!

3207 8825579 1458
Get away from the window!

3208 8827122 1375
Rogue wave!

3209 8828582 1041
Mayday!

3210 8829708 2585
This is Captain Ted Beecham
aboard the yacht Naomi!

3211 8832377 1501
- We are going down!
- I got 'em!

3212 8834337 1209
I got 'em!

3213 8836715 1542
Give me one for the nerves!

3214 8838341 1126
We're going down!

3215 8839551 2209
This is a fucking Mayday!

3216 8841845 2084
We require immediate assistance!

3217 8846183 1000
Hold on!

3218 8847267 1209
Watch out!

3219 8860155 2543
The nice thing about
getting rescued by Italians

3220 8862991 3544
is that they feed you,
make you drink red wine,

3221 8866620 1959
then you get to dance.

3222 8885180 1667
Did you see that?

3223 8887265 2919
That was the plane
I sent to come get us.

3224 8891102 3753
I shit you not, it exploded
when a seagull flew into the engine.

3225 8894940 2001
Three people killed.

3226 8901112 1835
You want a sign from God?

3227 8903031 3085
Well, after all this,
I finally got the message.

3228 8911581 3628
Do you dream of becoming
financially independent

3229 8915293 2669
but struggle every month
just to pay your bills?

3230 8918046 4086
Would you like to own a home like this,
but can barely afford to pay your rent?

3231 8922217 3711
My name is Jordan Belfort,
and there's no secret to wealth creation.

3232 8926012 2502
No matter who you are,
no matter where you came from,

3233 8928598 2585
you too can become
financially independent

3234 8931268 1750
in just a matter of months.

3235 8933103 2126
All you need is a strategy.

3236 8935313 1626
When I was 24 years old,

3237 8937023 3836
I made a decision
not just to survive, but to thrive.

3238 8940944 2460
At first I didn't feel like
deals like these were possible.

3239 8943488 3419
But we have the house
and we have a $33,000 profit.

3240 8946992 1125
I certainly believe now.

3241 8948201 1417
Think about it for a second.

3242 8949703 2126
If you don't have the guts
to attend Jordan Belfort's

3243 8951913 2168
Straight Line Persuasion
System seminar,

3244 8954165 1584
then how do you expect
to make any money?

3245 8955834 3753
If you want to be a millionaire someday,
have some guts. Make a decision.

3246 8959671 2752
Jordan Belfort's setup worked for me
because I worked hard for it.

3247 8962507 2543
And if it doesn't work for you,
it's because you're lazy.

3248 8965135 1625
And you should get a job at McDonald's.

3249 8966845 2418
There's nobody holding you back
from financial freedom.

3250 8969347 2919
And there's nobody stopping you
from making millions.

3251 8972350 1251
Don't just sit at home,

3252 8973685 2627
or the life of your dreams
will sail right past you.

3253 8979065 3628
I changed all these people's lives
and I can change yours, too!

3254 8982777 1251
So come to my seminar!

3255 8984112 1375
The life of your dreams is only...

3256 8985572 1709
Good to see you again, Jordan.

3257 8987365 1084
You're under arrest!

3258 8988533 1584
You gotta be joking!

3259 8991369 1251
You're kidding me.

3260 8992704 1584
Hey, get the fuck away from me!

3261 8994372 1251
Turn that camera off.

3262 8995707 2001
I'm fucking shooting
a fucking infomercial here,

3263 8997792 1376
you fucking cocksucker!

3264 8999252 1709
- Fuck you, you motherfucker!
- Shut the fucking camera off.

3265 9001046 1750
You don't got shit on me, you hear me!

3266 9002881 1083
Go fuck yourself!

3267 9004049 2376
I'm making an honest living,
you fucking piece of shit!

3268 9006509 2961
Hey, Jordan,
let me give you a little legal advice.

3269 9009554 1417
Shut the fuck up!

3270 9011056 1542
Oh, fuck you, you fucking prick!

3271 9012682 2543
I'm making an honest living,
you motherfucker!

3272 9017062 1417
I clean up my act.

3273 9018563 2585
I did rehab. I'm a TV personality.

3274 9021232 2752
I'm sober for two years.
And this happens!

3275 9024069 2209
Rugrat goes
and gets busted down in Miami.

3276 9026363 1250
I'm Swiss, I'm not communist.

3277 9027697 1668
And guess who the fuck with? Saurel.

3278 9029449 1042
- You gonna beat me?
- No, sir.

3279 9030575 2251
Yeah, I know your country.
You're gonna beat me.

3280 9032911 1751
I mean, what are the fucking odds?

3281 9034746 2627
There had to be 10,000
Swiss bankers in Geneva,

3282 9037457 3794
and Rugrat gets the one dumb enough
to get himself arrested on U.S. soil.

3283 9041336 1375
I know.

3284 9042837 1376
I'm so sorry.

3285 9046424 1209
Even more fucked

3286 9047717 3127
was that he got busted
for shit that had nothing to do with me.

3287 9050929 1584
It had nothing to fucking do with me.

3288 9052597 1959
Something about laundering drug money

3289 9054641 3085
through offshore boat racing
and a guy named Rocky Aoki,

3290 9057811 2126
you know, the founder of Benihana.

3291 9060021 1334
Benihana.

3292 9061439 3878
Beni-fucking-hana!

3293 9065402 958
Why?

3294 9066444 1376
Why, why, God?

3295 9067904 1459
Why would you be so cruel

3296 9069447 2585
as to choose
a chain of fucking hibachi restaurants

3297 9072117 1250
to take me down?

3298 9075787 2460
Long story short. Saurel rats me out.

3299 9078331 3127
But not before he rats out
Brad's wife, Chantalle,

3300 9081543 4086
who, it turns out, he'd been fucking
every time she went to Switzerland!

3301 9087632 2502
- No, no, no, it's impossible.
- Oui, oui, oui.

3302 9092345 1793
All right!

3303 9094222 3503
One count engaging in conspiracy
to commit securities fraud.

3304 9097809 2209
Two counts securities fraud.

3305 9100103 3461
One count engaging in conspiracy
to commit money laundering.

3306 9103648 2251
Twenty-one counts money laundering.

3307 9105984 2376
One count obstruction of justice.

3308 9109404 2209
Bail is set at $10 million.

3309 9126838 1584
Uncle Donnie's here!

3310 9129215 2252
Rocky. How you doing?

3311 9132761 1667
I hate that fucking dog.

3312 9134512 2335
Yeah, he's getting old and decrepit.

3313 9136931 1501
Starting to shit in the house again.

3314 9138516 1709
- Me, too.
- Come here, buddy.

3315 9140310 1292
Ah, fuck.

3316 9141686 1626
- It's good to see you, pal.
- Yeah, you, too.

3317 9143396 1209
Good to see you.

3318 9144689 2502
Sit down. Oh, man.

3319 9149068 1292
How you doing, brother?

3320 9151196 1500
You know.

3321 9152781 1667
Shitty, pal.

3322 9154532 2126
But I'm hanging in there.

3323 9157994 2502
My new piece of jewelry. Check that out.

3324 9160580 2376
Can't leave the house, you know?

3325 9163041 2585
Starting to get cabin fever already.

3326 9166211 1542
Fucking Rugrat.

3327 9168338 1292
That wig-wearing faggot.

3328 9169714 2126
I can't believe that fucking guy.
I wanna kill him.

3329 9171925 2585
Swear to God,
I want to choke him to death.

3330 9174594 2293
Irresponsible little prick.

3331 9177013 1042
I'll tell you one thing.

3332 9180433 2502
I'm never eating at Benihana again.

3333 9183812 2167
I don't care whose birthday it is.

3334 9187398 1543
Where's Naomi? How's she doing?

3335 9189734 1292
That's her in the house there.

3336 9191110 1960
You could say hi,
but she probably won't wave back.

3337 9193321 1626
Naomi, sweetheart!

3338 9198409 1251
What's up her ass?

3339 9199744 1542
- Is she mad at me?
- No, you know...

3340 9201371 1459
We probably have
to mortgage the house

3341 9202914 1792
in order to make bail.

3342 9204791 3711
Probably end up selling the thing
in order to pay for all the lawyers.

3343 9208586 2460
It's been a nightmare, buddy,
to tell you the truth.

3344 9211297 1709
What are you gonna do, right?

3345 9213800 2835
Anyway, how's Stratton?
That's more important.

3346 9216719 1084
How's morale?

3347 9217887 2627
They all pissed off 'cause they have
to make money legally now?

3348 9220598 1459
Jordan.

3349 9222433 2419
I got the founding partners together.

3350 9224936 2418
I talked to them about everything.

3351 9228106 1000
And I got you.

3352 9229941 1584
What do you mean, you got me?

3353 9232694 2751
The house, money,
don't worry about it. I got you.

3354 9241452 1084
All right.

3355 9242620 959
I love you, buddy.

3356 9243663 1918
- You know I'd do it for you, right?
- I know.

3357 9245665 1959
- You know that, right?
- I know.

3358 9248626 1125
I could fucking kiss you all over.

3359 9249836 1167
All right, enough, enough.

3360 9253089 1125
You want a beer, pal?

3361 9254299 1250
What are you drinking?

3362 9255633 2085
I got this non-alcoholic shit.

3363 9257802 1209
What's that?

3364 9259095 3002
A non-alcoholic beer. It's got no alcohol.

3365 9262181 2293
- It's a beer?
- Yeah, with no alcohol.

3366 9265018 1250
But if you drink enough,

3367 9266352 1918
if you drink a lot,
they get you fucked up?

3368 9268354 2085
No, there's no alcohol.
That's the fucking point.

3369 9270523 1042
I'm not a scientist.

3370 9271649 1167
I don't know what the fuck
you're talking about.

3371 9272901 1583
I can get you a beer
if you want a fucking beer.

3372 9274611 2126
I know, but I don't drink. You remember?

3373 9276821 1209
I don't drink anymore.

3374 9278114 2460
Oh, you wanna go inside
and blow some lines of baking powder?

3375 9280658 1167
Or baking soda...

3376 9282619 2293
Can't imagine ever not enjoying
getting fucked up.

3377 9284996 1417
- Yeah.
- I love it.

3378 9286497 1543
How's being sober?

3379 9288124 1834
- Fucking sucks.
- Boring, right?

3380 9290043 2418
So boring. I wanna kill myself.

3381 9293004 2543
There's a term,
and we don't like to use it

3382 9295632 1458
unless circumstances dictate,

3383 9297175 1959
and I think they do dictate in this case,

3384 9299218 1418
and the term is "Grenada."

3385 9300720 1542
Have you ever heard of Grenada?

3386 9302347 1041
No. No, I haven't.

3387 9303514 3503
Grenada's very interesting because
it is a small island nation

3388 9307101 3545
that was invaded by
the United States of America in 1983.

3389 9310730 2084
It's about 90,000 people.

3390 9312899 2251
And essentially, it means

3391 9315902 2001
this case is unloseable.

3392 9317987 1084
Okay?

3393 9319155 1584
So, you know, we can come in,

3394 9320823 1835
we can have our dick
hanging out of our pants.

3395 9322742 1167
Nobody gives a fuck.

3396 9323993 1542
I'm gonna win.

3397 9325703 1376
You, sir,

3398 9328623 1751
are what's known

3399 9331376 1208
as a Grenada.

3400 9335713 2335
You're looking at real prison time.

3401 9339217 2334
Money laundering
can get you as much as 20 years.

3402 9342553 2669
And our case couldn't be stronger
if we caught you

3403 9345306 1668
shoving cash in your mattress.

3404 9347058 1042
Is that right?

3405 9348977 2418
Hey, Jordan. Jordan.

3406 9352105 3836
Your rotting away in jail
till your kids get out of college,

3407 9356025 1626
that's not our ambition here.

3408 9359070 2543
There's other people
involved in this, too.

3409 9361698 3127
We think they need
to see their day in court as well.

3410 9367412 2042
Why do I sense
there's an offer in the air?

3411 9369539 2668
Look at him. He's got a sense.
What are you, Kreskin?

3412 9373418 2751
Full cooperation. He provides us
with a comprehensive list

3413 9376254 2376
of all the co-conspirators
spanning the last seven years,

3414 9378715 1959
and he also agrees to wear a wire.

3415 9380758 1251
Wait...

3416 9382093 1751
Did you just say "wear a wire"?

3417 9383928 1250
A wire.

3418 9385263 1375
What does that mean?

3419 9386723 1834
You want me to rat? Is that it?

3420 9388641 1292
No, I want you to cooperate.

3421 9390018 1917
- No. You want me to rat, right?
- Yes. We want you to rat.

3422 9392020 3836
That's fucking exactly
what we want you to do. To rat.

3423 9399944 1834
How was Cristy's party?

3424 9401863 1083
Fine.

3425 9403031 1375
Good.

3426 9405575 2460
Babe, I spoke
to the lawyers again today.

3427 9408119 2668
I have some really, really great news.

3428 9412623 2544
Turns out you're completely
off the hook, honey.

3429 9416127 1667
I know that already.

3430 9417879 1500
Right. Exactly.

3431 9419464 3210
You never did anything wrong
in the first place, right?

3432 9423634 2210
It turns out, all the FBI really

3433 9426512 3670
wants from me is to cooperate.

3434 9430433 1208
You know?

3435 9431726 3002
Turns out I have so much information
about the stock market and Wall Street,

3436 9434812 1793
I could save the government
years of heartache,

3437 9436689 2627
not to mention countless dollars.

3438 9440818 2335
But it gets even better, babe.

3439 9443613 2543
Because if I do decide to cooperate,

3440 9446532 2835
I might only be looking
at four short years,

3441 9449452 1459
in which case, you know,

3442 9450995 3044
we could start fresh,
maybe sell the house.

3443 9454123 1626
And any fines that I'd have to pay

3444 9455833 1793
wouldn't be due
till after I serve my term,

3445 9457710 2293
so we'd still have plenty
of money left over, you know?

3446 9462673 2419
The only thing that
of course bummed me out a little bit

3447 9465176 5046
is this whole idea of having to
give information about my friends.

3448 9470306 3211
Like you said, "There's no friends
on Wall Street." Right?

3449 9473601 1959
Right. Right. Exactly.

3450 9475645 1584
There's a silver lining
to that, too, honey.

3451 9477313 1667
Because they said eventually...

3452 9479065 2877
Eventually everyone's gonna have
to give information on this case.

3453 9482026 2794
So, at the end of the day, it might
not even be a factor. You know?

3454 9484904 2126
Well, that's good news. Right?

3455 9487156 1709
Yeah, yeah.

3456 9488950 1709
I'm really happy for you.

3457 9492036 3252
What do you mean,
happy for me, sweetheart?

3458 9496207 2585
You should be happy for
the both of us. Right?

3459 9498876 1960
- Yeah, right.
- All right.

3460 9502922 1626
Come here, baby.

3461 9505049 1542
Give me a kiss, sweetheart.

3462 9506676 1000
Jordan...

3463 9507760 1209
Oh, come on, baby.

3464 9509053 2210
I haven't made love to you
in so long. Please.

3465 9511347 2418
- No. Jordan, stop it.
- Come on, honey, please.

3466 9513850 1417
No! Jordan, stop it!

3467 9517019 2210
I've loved you
since the moment I saw you.

3468 9523109 1876
I fucking hate you, Jordan.

3469 9525570 2543
- Get off me!
- Baby... Don't do that.

3470 9528990 1917
You know how much I love you, right?

3471 9531409 2168
Stop that, sweetie. Please.

3472 9538833 2043
You wanna fuck me, Jordan?

3473 9542628 1709
You wanna fuck me?

3474 9545339 1125
Good.

3475 9546549 1334
Go ahead.

3476 9548384 1918
Go ahead and fuck me.

3477 9551387 2418
I want you to fuck me real hard.

3478 9553931 2669
I want you to fuck me like
it's the last fucking time.

3479 9556684 1334
- Why are you moving like that?
- Come on.

3480 9558102 958
Please hold still.

3481 9559145 1542
'Cause I want you to come for me, baby.

3482 9560771 1334
Come on, babe.

3483 9562190 1500
Come for me, baby.

3484 9563774 1209
I want you to come for me

3485 9565067 1459
like it's the last fucking time.

3486 9566611 1458
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

3487 9568154 2585
Come on, baby. Come for me.
Come for me, baby.

3488 9570823 1125
Come on, baby.

3489 9572033 1333
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

3490 9573451 1917
- Yeah, baby, come.
- You want me to come for you?

3491 9575453 1167
Yeah.

3492 9577455 1959
- You want me to come for you?
- Yeah!

3493 9579498 2335
Huh? You want me to come for you?

3494 9583669 1709
Oh, God, baby. Yeah!

3495 9585463 2501
Oh, God. Oh, God.

3496 9589300 4420
Oh, God.

3497 9593804 1251
Jesus.

3498 9598684 1334
Oh, baby.

3499 9600102 2502
That was so fucking great!

3500 9602688 1292
Oh, God!

3501 9606317 1959
That was the last time.

3502 9608778 1959
What do you mean, baby?

3503 9610821 2961
I mean that was the last time
we ever have sex.

3504 9614784 2042
What are you talking about?

3505 9618829 1668
I want a divorce.

3506 9622083 2001
What do you mean, you want a divorce?

3507 9624168 2043
What's that supposed to mean,
you want a divorce?

3508 9626295 1876
Get off me! I want a divorce.

3509 9628506 1250
You just made love to me.

3510 9629840 1084
What the fuck is wrong with you?

3511 9631008 2335
I don't love you anymore, Jordan!

3512 9634637 1959
Oh, you don't love me?

3513 9637014 1584
You don't love me anymore, huh?

3514 9638683 2251
Well, isn't that just fucking
convenient for you!

3515 9641018 1834
Now that I'm under federal indictment,

3516 9642937 1959
with an electronic bracelet
around my ankle,

3517 9644981 1709
now you decide you don't
fucking love me anymore.

3518 9646774 1751
- Is that right?
- No, no.

3519 9648859 2252
What kind of person are you? Tell me.

3520 9651195 1250
You married me!

3521 9652530 1500
What the fuck is that
supposed to mean?

3522 9654115 1667
Jordan, this is how it's gonna go.

3523 9655866 2168
I'm gonna take custody of the kids.

3524 9658119 3544
If you agree to the divorce right now,
I will allow visitation.

3525 9661789 1834
- Okay? Don't try to fight it.
- Oh, my God.

3526 9663708 4169
It'll save us both a lot of money
and I got a feeling you're gonna need it.

3527 9669422 3210
You're not taking my kids, sweetheart.
You hear me?

3528 9672717 1417
I've already talked to the lawyer.

3529 9674218 1250
He said even if you don't get convicted,

3530 9675553 1083
I've got a good chance of getting them.

3531 9676721 1083
I got news for you.

3532 9677888 3420
You're not fucking taking my children,
you vicious fucking cunt, you!

3533 9681851 1959
Fuck you, you fucking bitch!

3534 9683894 2168
You're not fucking taking
my goddamn fucking kids!

3535 9686147 1375
You hear me? Fuck you!

3536 9687732 2751
You're not fucking
taking my fucking kids!

3537 9699076 1793
Fucking bitch!

3538 9703331 1375
Fucking whore!

3539 9709086 2669
Fucking bitch!
Piece of shit fucking whore!

3540 9720931 2752
Look at yourself, Jordan.

3541 9723768 1166
You're sick!

3542 9725019 1167
You're a sick man!

3543 9726270 2043
Fuck you! I told you,
you're not taking my fucking kids!

3544 9728397 2460
You think I would let my kids near you?

3545 9730941 1167
Look at yourself!

3546 9732193 1500
You know what my lawyer said?

3547 9733778 3460
My lawyer said that you're going
to prison for 20 years, Jordan.

3548 9737323 3252
Twenty fucking years!
You're never gonna see the kids again!

3549 9740659 1209
You don't think I'm not gonna see my...

3550 9741952 1751
No, I'm not fucking
letting you near my kids!

3551 9743788 2167
You don't think I'm gonna see
my fucking kids again, huh?

3552 9746040 1542
Don't you fucking touch them!

3553 9748918 1792
Don't you fucking touch me!

3554 9752421 3252
Sweetheart? You're coming
on a trip with Daddy, all right?

3555 9755758 1959
You're coming on a trip with Daddy.

3556 9760471 2251
Don't you fucking touch her, Jordan.

3557 9762807 2751
I swear to God, I will fucking kill you!

3558 9768229 1250
It's all right, baby.

3559 9769563 2710
You and Daddy are gonna go
on a little trip together, okay?

3560 9772358 1542
- A little trip together.
- Violet!

3561 9773984 1084
Violet!

3562 9775152 2210
- Get the key! Get the key!
- I got it!

3563 9777446 1626
Jordan, you open this fucking door

3564 9779156 2794
- right now! Open the door!
- Put your seat belt on.

3565 9782034 1334
There you go. Get your legs in.

3566 9783452 1626
I'm taking her with me!

3567 9785162 2627
I told you I'm taking her with me,
you fucking bitch!

3568 9787873 2710
You're not gonna stop me!
You're not gonna stop me!

3569 9791377 2084
We're going on a little trip, honey.

3570 9793879 1501
No! No!

3571 9796006 1376
Get the hell out of here!

3572 9797466 2126
Leave that baby alone!

3573 9799677 2168
Violet! Garage door! Close it!

3574 9801929 1125
Mommy!

3575 9803180 2168
- Get out of here!
- Open the fucking door!

3576 9806267 1125
Mommy!

3577 9810438 1625
No!

3578 9819363 2752
Oh, Lord! Oh, my heavens...

3579 9822199 1292
Get the baby!

3580 9823576 2126
Naomi, get the baby!

3581 9826454 1667
- Mommy.
- Honey, it's okay.

3582 9828205 1251
It's gonna be okay.

3583 9829540 2001
Oh, Mr. Jordan has lost his mind.

3584 9832543 1792
- Baby...
- It's all right, honey.

3585 9834420 1584
She all right?

3586 9836088 1292
Is she all right?

3587 9838132 1584
What's the matter with you?

3588 9839967 1334
Is she all right?

3589 9848684 1375
Paragraph one.

3590 9850144 1500
The defendant shall plead guilty

3591 9851729 3419
to all counts of the indictment
currently pending against him

3592 9855232 3836
in the United States District Court
for the Eastern District of New York.

3593 9859570 1083
Paragraph two.

3594 9860738 1125
Talk normally.

3595 9861947 3211
The defendant shall participate
in undercover activities...

3596 9865242 1125
Breathe normally.

3597 9866452 3544
...including wearing a recording device,
also known as a wire...

3598 9870080 2168
After five minutes,
you'll forget you even have it on.

3599 9872333 1125
...in conjunction with the investigation...

3600 9873542 1542
Fucking brutal.

3601 9875211 1250
Quit your bitching.

3602 9876545 1834
Paragraph four.
The defendant must not commit,

3603 9878464 2168
or attempt to commit,
any further crimes.

3604 9880716 3461
Please. Let me just sign
the fucking thing already.

3605 9884261 1376
Thank you.

3606 9888599 1167
Just here?

3607 9889850 1542
That'd be good.

3608 9893103 1126
Thank you.

3609 9894313 1626
It wasn't even a choice.

3610 9896982 3002
For the next six hours,
I came up with a list.

3611 9900277 2919
Friends, enemies, business associates.

3612 9903280 4087
Anybody who'd ever known me
or taken so much as a stock tip.

3613 9912915 2293
Wolfie! Wolfie! Wolfie!

3614 9917002 2794
The first name on the list was Donnie.

3615 9922174 3127
Jordan, do you know how good it is
to have you back in this office?

3616 9925678 2042
It's not the same when you're gone.

3617 9927805 1751
It's sad, you understand? It's like...

3618 9929640 1417
That fucking Steve Madden, huh?

3619 9931141 1167
I can't...

3620 9932393 1834
Swear to God, I can't even think about it.

3621 9934311 1876
Every time I think about him,
my blood boils.

3622 9936272 1667
I can't even say his name.

3623 9938023 1543
- I know.
- It's, like, disgusting.

3624 9939650 2376
I grew up with this guy
and he betrays me like that.

3625 9943320 2919
He ever get back to you about that...

3626 9946991 1750
About that account?

3627 9954582 1041
You remember.

3628 9955708 2001
It was like four or five mil,
something like that, right?

3629 9957793 3127
He was supposed
to kick back four or five mil, was it?

3630 9965342 1459
Actually, I was...

3631 9966885 1376
I was fucked up, Jordan,

3632 9968345 1501
- so I don't really remember.
- Yeah.

3633 9969930 2001
Yeah, right. Stupid.

3634 9972600 4003
Well, if he calls you,
you make sure and contact me, okay?

3635 9978439 1667
- Yeah. Of course.
- Yeah.

3636 9980190 2085
Of course, yeah. No, of course.

3637 9985696 2501
You gonna eat
that last piece of yellowtail, bud?

3638 9989241 1751
No, it's all yours.

3639 9991827 1334
Can I get this?

3640 9995664 1709
So, what else is...

3641 10000127 2001
Well, how's Naomi and everything?

3642 10002212 1418
You know how it is.

3643 10003714 2084
She hates my fucking guts.

3644 10007551 1667
How's Hildy? Good?

3645 10010054 3586
She's still alive,
so my life is fucked, you know?

3646 10013724 1167
Yeah.

3647 10021732 1500
Mr. Jordan.

3648 10024902 2168
Mr. Jordan, you got a visitor.

3649 10027446 1042
What?

3650 10028947 1793
You've got a visitor.

3651 10046256 2001
I need you to get dressed.

3652 10048342 2209
Why? What the fuck's going on?

3653 10055599 1793
You're going to jail.

3654 10069321 1209
All right.

3655 10070614 1584
I'll get some clothes on.

3656 10072282 2335
We'll give you a hand with that.

3657 10083210 1083
Okay.

3658 10096515 1250
FBI!

3659 10098183 3586
Everybody sit down. Put your hands
where they can be seen, and shut up!

3660 10101854 1709
Don't you fucking touch me.

3661 10103647 2126
Get your fucking hands off me!

3662 10105858 1750
Don't get out of your seats!

3663 10120831 1626
It's fucking Chanel!

3664 10135095 2085
I gave up everyone.

3665 10137347 1501
And in return,

3666 10138932 4379
I got three years in some hellhole
in Nevada I'd never even heard of.

3667 10145189 2376
Like my pops, Mad Max, had said,

3668 10148358 2585
"The chickens had come home to roost."

3669 10152362 2210
Whatever the fuck that means.

3670 10158160 1292
I hope Your Honor would agree

3671 10159536 2001
that Mr. Belfort
has distinguished himself

3672 10161622 2084
in terms of his cooperation.

3673 10163791 2042
Mr. Belfort has helped
the government win convictions

3674 10165918 2543
of over two dozen serious offenders

3675 10169713 1918
and helped them
recover millions of dollars

3676 10171715 3419
to be made available
for restitution to their victims.

3677 10177387 3670
The sentence of the court shall be
36 months in federal prison.

3678 10182893 2126
Please remand the defendant.

3679 10187231 1709
I'm sorry.

3680 10191860 1042
That's okay.

3681 10241285 2418
I'm not ashamed to admit it.

3682 10243787 1834
When we arrived at the prison,

3683 10245706 2168
I was absolutely terrified.

3684 10248667 1375
Belfort, on your feet.

3685 10250127 2293
But I needn't have been.

3686 10252629 2627
You see, for a brief fleeting moment,

3687 10255966 2043
I'd forgotten I was rich.

3688 10259011 3460
And I lived in a place
where everything was for sale.

3689 10264975 2710
Wouldn't you like to learn how to sell it?

3690 10267769 2877
So listen. I've met some
bad motherfuckers in my life.

3691 10270731 3460
I'm talking about rock stars,
professional athletes, gangsters.

3692 10274276 1792
I'm telling you,
some real bad motherfuckers.

3693 10276153 2293
But this guy, my good friend,

3694 10278530 2752
Mr. Jordan Belfort, is the single

3695 10281366 2794
baddest motherfucker I have ever met.

3696 10284703 1709
So I want you right now

3697 10286496 3128
to give a warm Auckland,
New Zealand welcome

3698 10289708 4378
for my good friend
and the world's greatest sales trainer,

3699 10294171 2251
Mr. Jordan Belfort!

3700 10307392 1292
Thank you.

3701 10331667 1709
Sell me this pen.

3702 10337965 2042
It's...

3703 10340300 1751
It's an amazing pen.

3704 10342386 2167
For professionals, it's a...

3705 10347683 1709
Sell me this pen.

3706 10350394 1208
Well, it's a nice pen.

3707 10351687 1292
You can use the pen

3708 10353063 3210
to write down thoughts
from your life so you can...

3709 10358068 3336
Sell me this pen.

3710 10363407 1208
Well...

3711 10364992 3585
This pen works
and I personally love this pen...
