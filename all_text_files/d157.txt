a man of fine breeding.

Five years ago. In Louisville.

Daisy...

926 2742991 2461

Hello, Jordan.

One of them was...

930 2750207 1126
...in the car with her.

931 2751541 2211
It was Gatsby.

932 2753961 1793

939 2768141 668
...to war.

940 2769851 1085
When the war ended...

941 2771353 1043
...Daisy waited.

942 2772604 4213
But for some unknown reason,
Gatsby couldn't return.

943 2777317 5130
A year later, Tom Buchanan of Chicago
swept in and stole her away.

944 2782739 2962
He gave her a string of pearls
worth $350,000.

945 2788620 1585
But the morning of the wedding...

946 2790414 1920

She wouldn't tell me.

954 2805679 1209
But it was too late.

955 2807889 2420
That day at 5:00, Daisy Fay...

956 2810517 1040
...married Tom Buchanan...

957 2811601 2560
...with more pomp and circumstance
than Louisville had ever seen.

Congratulations, Mr. Buchanan!

959 2820319 3378
After the honeymoon,
I saw them in Santa Barbara.

960 2823905 4171
Well, it was touching, really. I'd never
seen a girl so in love with her husband.

961 2828285 1209
A week later, Tom...

962 2829703 1376
...crashed his car.

963 2831288 2127
The girl with him was a chambermaid
at the Santa Barbara Hotel.

964 2833707 2085
It got into all the papers.

965 2836918 2628
NICK: It's a strange coincidence.
JORDAN: What is?

966 2839755 2877
NICK: The fact that Gatsby's house
is just across the bay.

967 2843592 1251
It's no coincidence.

968 2845344 2711
He bought that house to be near her.

969 2848263 3420
He threw all those parties
hoping she'd wander in one night.

970 2851892 4421
He constantly asked about Daisy.
I was just the first person that knew her.

971 2857439 2628
All that for a girl
he hasn't seen in five years.

972 2860400 2544
And now he just wants me
to invite her over to tea.

want to see Gatsby?

She's absolutely not to know.

980 2878335 1710

1645 5460957 1251
Come on, Jordan.

1646 5467421 2211
Will you join us, Mr. Gatsby?

1647 5470716 1760
Two bottles of whiskey.
Wrap them in a towel.

1648 5472802 959
Come on, Nick!

1649 5478849 1085
TOM:
Mr. Gatsby...

1650 5480851 1585
...would you be good enough to take...

1651 5482603 1835
...my coupe,
and I'll drive everyone else...

1652 5484605 1251
...in your circus wagon.
GATSBY: I don't think...

1653 5486023 1752
...there's much gas, old sport.

1654 5488025 1210
TOM:
No, plenty of gas.

1655 5490027 1293
Well, if I run out, I'll stop...

1656 5491487 1543
...at a drugstore. I hear you can...

1657 5493197 1561
...buy anything at a drugstore
nowadays.

1658 5496575 1001
You take Nick and Jordan.

1659 5497743 1160
GATSBY:
I suppose you can...

1660 5499036 3045
- ...yes.
- We'll meet you at the Plaza.

1661 5502248 917
I'll be the man on the corner...

1662 5503332 1752
...smoking two cigarettes!

1663 5512008 2085
TOM: You must think I'm pretty dumb,
don't you?

1664 5514260 2753
Well, I have a second sight sometimes
that tells me what to do.

1665 5517346 1920
I've made a small investigation
into this fellow.

1666 5519432 1200
JORDAN:
And you found he was...

1667 5520641 1710
- ...an Oxford man?
- Oxford, New Mexico.

1668 5522518 1960
He wears a pink suit, for chrissake.

Wilson!

Wilson!

1676 5560765 1001
What are you waiting for?

1677 5561932 1836
- Let's have some gas!
- Uhh.

1678 5564310 1251
Do I have to do it myself?

1679 5566020 1601
You think I come here
to admire the view?

1680 5567772 2419
- I'm sorry, I'm sick.
TOM: Why?

1681 5571358 1841
- Why, what's the matter?
WILSON: I don't know.

1682 5573652 681
I'm all run down.

1683 5575321 709
I need money...

1684 5576197 1418
- ...real bad.
- What?

1685 5577782 1710
My wife and I, we wanna go West.

1686 5581744 1001
Oh, your wife does?

1687 5584371 1127
NICK: <i
Tom was feeling...

1688 5585664 3045
...the hot whips of panic. His mistress...

1689 5588876 1043
...and wife...

1690 5590086 1626
...an hour ago so secure...

1691 5592505 2252
...were both slipping from his control.

I wised up to something...

1693 5596967 1377
...funny these last two days.

1694 5599845 1001
Yeah, she's going West...

1695 5601013 1710
...whether she wants to or not.

1696 5604809 792
What do I owe you?

1697 5605768 917
WILSON:
A dollar.

1698 5606852 2086
- $1.20.
TOM: You can have the car.

1699 5609105 1167
I'll send it over tomorrow!

Will you forget about the heat?

1706 5676422 1668
You make it worse by crabbing about it.

1707 5678257 1460
Why not let her alone, old sport?

1708 5682761 1419
TOM:
That's a great expression...

1709 5684346 1335
...of yours, isn't it?

1710 5685848 1126
GATSBY:
What is?

1711 5687516 1627
"Old sport."

1712 5689310 1501

- See here.

1713 5690978 1543

...I won't stay here a minute.

Mr. Gatsby...

1716 5696734 1680
...I understand that you're an Oxford man.

1717 5703032 1251
No, not exactly, no.

1718 5704450 1293
Oh, yes, I understand that...

1719 5705910 1167
...you went to Oxford.

1720 5709288 2044
- Well, yes, I went there.
TOM: Sure.

1721 5712166 2544
- The man in the pink suit went to Oxford.
- Tom.

1722 5715836 1627
I said I went there, didn't I?

1723 5717630 1167
TOM:
Oh, I heard you.

1724 5719089 1961
I'd like to know when.

1725 5721675 1752
You'd like to know when.

1726 5733896 1293
Well, Mr. Gatsby?

1727 5738150 2586
It was in 1919.
I only stayed there five months.

1728 5740903 2127
That's why I can't exactly call myself...

1729 5743197 1418
...an Oxford man.

1730 5744782 2836
You see, it was an opportunity
they gave to some of us officers...

1731 5747785 1418
...who fought in the war.

I'll make you a drink, Tom.

1735 5756502 2520
- Then you won't seem so stupid to yourself.
TOM: Wait a minute.

1736 5759713 2711
I want to ask Mr. Gatsby
one more question.

1737 5762591 2670
Oh, please, please, go on,
Mr. Buchanan. Go on.

1738 5765761 3879
What kind of a row are you trying
to cause in my house anyhow?

1739 5770182 4004
He isn't causing a row, you're causing
a row. Please have a little self-control.

1740 5774353 1418
Self-control?

1741 5776689 792
Oh, I suppose...

1742 5777648 2044
...the latest thing is to sit back...

1743 5779858 2378
...and let Mr. Nobody From Nowhere...

1744 5782403 1501
...make love to your wife.

1745 5784071 1543
Well, if that's the idea...

1746 5785781 1168
...you can count me out.

1747 5787116 959
See, nowadays people...

1748 5788242 921
...begin by sneering...

1749 5789243 2127
...at family life and
family institutions...

1750 5792037 1480
...and the next you'll know, we'll...

1751 5793664 1752
...throw everything overboard,
we'll have intermarriage...

1752 5795582 1377
...between black and white!

1753 5797126 1440
GATSBY:
Your wife doesn't love you.

1754 5804258 667
She never...

1755 5805092 959
...loved you.

1756 5806218 1335
You see, she loves me.

1757 5812433 1001
You must be crazy.

1758 5813892 1836
No, old sport.

1759 5815978 3295
No, you see, she never loved you.

1760 5819648 1710
She only married you
because I was poor...

1761 5821525 2080
...and she was tired of waiting.
It was a terrible...

1762 5824278 2794
...terrible mistake, but in her heart...

1763 5827239 1418
In her heart, she never loved...

1764 5828824 1293
...anyone but me.

1765 5830284 1501
- We should go.
- Let's all go home.

1766 5831952 1877
- Sit down, Daisy!
GATSBY: Please.

1767 5834663 801
Please, take a seat.

1768 5836707 1418
Go on, Daisy.

1769 5839835 1293
TOM:
Daisy...

1770 5842504 1085
...what's been going on?

1771 5843756 2201
- I want to hear about it.
- I told you what's going on.

1772 5846050 1710
It's been going on for five years.

1773 5848052 1751
You've been seeing him...

1774 5851055 1293
...for five years?

1775 5852514 3295
No, no, no, not seeing.
Not seeing, we couldn't. But...

1776 5855976 3003
...both of us loved each other
all that time. Didn't we?

1777 5859355 1001
TOM:
Oh, that's all.

1778 5861398 1710
Ha-ha-ha! You're crazy!

1779 5863734 880
I can't speak about...

1780 5864735 3378
...what happened five years ago
because I didn't know Daisy then.

1781 5868280 2961
And I'll be damned if I see how
you got within a mile of her...

1782 5871408 2753
...unless you brought the groceries
to the back door.

1783 5874370 1209
But all the rest of that...

1784 5875746 1376
...is a goddamn lie.

1785 5877289 709
Daisy loved me...

1786 5878165 1627
...when she married me...

1787 5880209 1418
...and she loves me now.
GATSBY: No.

1788 5881794 2419
- No. I'm sorry, Mr. Buchanan, no.
TOM: She does! She does, though.

1789 5884380 875
No, she does, though.

1790 5885422 2586
She does. And what's
more, I love Daisy too.

1791 5889301 959
No.

1792 5891387 1001
I love you, Daisy.

1793 5893472 1084
Now, once in a while...

1794 5894723 2461
...I go off on a spree. I always come back.

1795 5897351 2502
- A spree. TOM: And in my heart
I love her all the time.

1796 5900020 1335
You're revolting.

1797 5901522 921
You know why we left...

1798 5902564 2002
...Chicago? I'm surprised
they didn't treat you...

1799 5904733 1543
...to the story of that little spree!

1800 5906443 3003
That's all over now, Daisy, darling.
That's all over.

1801 5909613 1543
Just tell him the truth. Go on.

1802 5911323 3879
That you never loved him
and this will all be wiped out forever.

1803 5915369 1126
How could I love him...

1804 5916662 2169
...possibly?
GATSBY: Remember our plans.

1805 5918997 1880
You tell him that you never loved him
and all...

1806 5921041 1627
...this pain will be wiped out...

1807 5922835 959
...forever.

1808 5924670 1126
Daisy.

1809 5927423 2043
Daisy, tell him.

1810 5929675 1334
I never loved him.

1811 5932719 1127
Never?

1812 5934179 1877
- No.
- No.

1813 5937349 1710
Not at Kapiolani?

1814 5942896 3212
Not that day I carried you down from
the Punch Bowl to keep your shoes dry?

1815 5951071 834
Never?

1816 5952865 1751
Please don't.

1817 5955242 1168
Daisy.

1818 5957703 1710
There, Jay.

1819 5960038 1210
You want too much.

1820 5961707 1001
I love you now...

1821 5962875 1480
...isn't that enough? I can't help...

1822 5964501 1168
...what's past.

1823 5965836 2419
I did love him once,
but I loved you too.

1824 5971049 2378
You loved me too?

1825 5973594 1209
You loved me...?

1826 5974970 1001
Even that is a lie!

1827 5976138 959
She didn't know you were alive!

1828 5977264 1668
There are things between Daisy and me...

1829 5979099 1361
...Gatsby, that you'll never know.

1830 5980601 1751
- Things that neither of us can ever forget.
GATSBY: I need to...

1831 5982519 1168
...speak to Daisy alone.

1832 5983854 3337
You see, you've got her
all excited now, don't you...

1833 5987357 1836
...old sport? Daisy.
DAISY: Even alone...

1834 5989359 2795
...I can't say I never loved Torn.
It wouldn't be true.

1835 5992321 1240
- What?
- Of course it wouldn't.

1836 5993655 2120
- As if it mattered to you.
TOM: Of course it matters!

1837 5995866 1801
I'm gonna take better care of you
from now on.

1838 5997826 3253
You're not taking care of Daisy
anymore. She's leaving you.

1839 6001246 1168
Nonsense!

1840 6002581 1877
- I am, though!
TOM: No, no, no.

1841 6004625 1042
She is not leaving me.

1842 6005834 918
Certainly not...

1843 6006919 1418
...for a common swindler...

1844 6008504 1001
...like you.

1845 6009671 2461
Mr. Gatsby, exactly who are you, anyhow?

1846 6012299 1043
I made an investigation...

1847 6013509 1400
...into your affairs. You're one...

1848 6015052 1200
...of Meyer Wolfshiem's bunch.

1849 6016386 1377
Please, let's go home.

1850 6017930 1418
See, he and this Wolfshiem...

1851 6019515 1418
...they bought up drugstores.

1852 6021099 1252
And sold bootlegged...

1853 6022518 1126
...alcohol over the counter.

1854 6023810 1335
What about it, old sport?

1855 6025312 1210
Don't you call me "old sport."

1856 6026688 1418
And this drugstore business...

1857 6028273 2503
...is just small change
compared to this bonds stunt...

1858 6030943 1601
...that you and Wolfshiem
have got going.

1859 6032569 1081
Your friend Walter Chase...

1860 6033779 1640
- ...isn't too proud to come in?
- I gave.

1861 6035572 840
...that some thought.

1862 6036573 1335
How does a reputable banker...

1863 6038075 1668
...like Walter Chase find himself...

1864 6039910 1460
...up to his eyeballs in debt...

1865 6041537 1835
GATSBY: I'll tell you.
- ...to a little kike like Wolfshiem?

1866 6043539 2252
- It's called greed, old sport.
TOM: That's right!

1867 6046124 2795
And you have half of Wall Street
out there swilling your...

1868 6049086 2752
...free booze at that fun park
every weekend.

1869 6052005 1760
I'm surprised he hasn't
tried to drag you in.

1870 6056301 1126
My God, he has.

1871 6057594 1251
He's got nothing to do with...

1872 6059012 1293
With your little racket.

1873 6062641 1209
Daisy.

1874 6064059 1251
Daisy.

1875 6066270 2294
Can't you see who this guy is...

1876 6068730 4880
...with his house and his parties
and his fancy clothes?

1877 6074278 1960
He is just a front...

1878 6076405 2127
...for Wolfshiem, a gangster...

1879 6078699 2360
...to get his claws into respectable folk
like Walter Chase.

1880 6081201 3295
The only respectable thing about you,
old sport, is your money.

1881 6084663 1841
Your money, that's it.
Now I've just as much...

1882 6086665 1376
...as you. That means we're equal.

1883 6088208 959
Oh, no. No.

1884 6090586 1001
We're different.

1885 6092588 1376
I am.

1886 6094256 1209
They are.

1887 6095632 1126
She is.

1888 6096925 1335
We're all different from you.

1889 6098844 1543
You see, we were born...

1890 6100846 1543
...different.

1891 6103348 1502
It's in our blood...

1892 6105225 3754
...and nothing that you do
or say or steal...

1893 6109396 2336
...or dream up can ever change that.

1894 6112608 1251
A girl like Daisy...

1895 6114026 1209
You shut up!

1896 6115402 751
Shut up!

1897 6116320 2335
You shut up! Shut up!

1898 6118822 1710
Shut up!

Mr. Gatsby, sir, excuse me.

Chicago calling, sir.

2176 7111647 1251
Not now.

2177 7113566 2753
Keep it open for a personal call.

Mr. Gatsby, I'm gonna drain the pool.

2180 7121741 1877
Before the leaves start falling in.

2181 7123784 1460
Not today.

2182 7127872 2002
Not today, it's so beautiful.

2183 7131000 5339
You know, old sport, I haven't used that
pool once all summer. Let's take a swim.

2184 7137757 1877
Have the phone brought down to the pool.

2185 7153606 1752
I have to go, Jay.

2186 7158027 1418
I have to work.

Well...

Well, I'll call you up.

Please do, old sport. Please do.

2192 7182009 709
I suppose...

golden roar.

But I wasn't worth a decent stroke of work.

The headlines were a nightmare.

The affair with Myrtle.
The hit-and-run. Everything.

Please. I know that she would
want to be there. She would...

at the end of Daisy's dock.

2304 7673458 2336
He had come such a long way.

2305 7676587 2460

must have seemed so close...

2306 7679214 2962
...that he could hardly fail to grasp it.

2307 7686513 1126
But he did not know...

2308 7687806 2127
...that it was already behind him.

2309 7691768 2962
Gatsby believed in the green light...

2310 7694938 3379
...the orgastic future
that year by year recedes...

2311 7698483 1127
...before us.
