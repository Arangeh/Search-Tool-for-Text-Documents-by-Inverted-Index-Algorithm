DUKE:
I am no one special...

4 200534 2918
...just a common man
with common thoughts.

5 203620 2418
l've led a common life.

6 206206 1834
There are no monuments
dedicated to me.

7 208208 2627
And my name
will soon be forgotten.

8 211003 1709
But in one respect...

9 212880 3335
...I've succeeded as gloriously
as anyone who ever lived.

10 216383 1959
-Looking good, Duke.
-Feeling good.

11 218510 2960
I've loved another
with all my heart and soul...

12 221638 2669
...and for me that has
always been enough.

13 224474 1418
How's it hanging, Harry?

14 226059 2460
I keep trying to die,
but they won't let me.

15 228687 2627
Well, you can't have everything.

Big day today.

You say that every day,
you old devil.

18 239406 1584
It's a lovely day outside.

19 241158 2001
Let's take a walk.

20 243327 1166
I don't think so.

21 244661 2335
Well, we've got to get
you out of this room.

22 247164 2793
Come on now, honey.
Some fresh air would do you good.

23 250125 1459
Hello.

24 253003 2293
I'm sorry, it's not a good day.

25 255464 1876
I don't think she's up for anything.

26 257507 1584
Hello?

27 260135 3878
This is Duke, he's come to read to you.

28 264181 2460
-Read?
-Mm-hm.

29 267726 2793

I wanted to clear that up with you.
I'm really sorry about that.

It was a really stupid thing to do,
crawl up a Ferris wheel to talk to somebody.

He decided right there
to fulfill his lifelong dream.

He would rebuild the old house
from the ground up.

After seeing Allie that day...

910 3435933 2960
...something inside Noah snapped.

911 3439061 1459
He got the notion into his head...

912 3440687 3711
...that if he restored the old house
where they had come that night...

913 3444566 3378
...Allie would find a way
to come back to him.

...then finally put the house up for sale.

937 3527065 2043
I'm prepared to offer you this much.

938 3530777 2001
He had a number of interested buyers...

939 3532946 2877
...but he always found a reason
not to sell it to them.

940 3535991 1167
No.

941 3537326 1959
Either their bids were too low...

942 3539453 4628
...or if they met his asking price,
he felt it was worth a lot more.

943 3544249 3002

that offered him $5000 over his price...

948 3564645 2710
...that no one in his right mind
would do that...

949 3567522 3837

a lunatic living in his house.

I'm afraid your father
spilled the beans about Noah.

1313 5417913 1667
When Lon didn't
hear from you last night...

1314 5419748 2251
-...he decided to come.
-Well, that's great.

1315 5422167 1918
Ha-ha-ha. That's just terrific.

But they were also very irresponsible.

-Was that a test that I didn't pass?

-l'll find out when l talk to him.
-This is not about keeping your promise.

And it's not about following your heart.

a two-second rebound rate...
