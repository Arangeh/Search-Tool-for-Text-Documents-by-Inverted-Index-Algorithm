CARTER [IN VOICEOVER]:
Edward Perriman Cole died in May.

2 31573 4920
It was a Sunday afternoon,
and there wasn't a cloud in the sky.

3 37746 4128
It's difficult to understand
the sum of a person's life.

4 42042 3961
Some people will tell you it's measured
by the ones left behind.

5 46713 2918
Some believe it can be measured
in faith.

6 50175 2251
Some say by love.

7 53178 3627
Other folks say life has
no meaning at all.

8 57390 1542
Me?

9 59642 1835
I believe that you measure yourself...

10 61644 3044
...by the people who
measured themselves by you.

11 65607 3794
What I can tell you for sure
is that, by any measure...

12 69569 3669
...Edward Cole lived more in his last
days on Earth...

13 73406 3419
...than most people manage
to wring out of a lifetime.

14 77619 3961
I know that when he died,
his eyes were closed...

15 81748 2126
...and his heart was open.

16 90840 4462
MAN 1 : "Name the five presidents whose
last names begin with the letter H."

17 95470 1459
H?

18 97388 4212
Warren G. Harding,
Rutherford B. Hayes, Herbert Hoover...

19 101810 4169
...and the two Harrisons,
Benjamin and William Henry.

20 106147 1042
Ah.

21 107357 1834
Thought I'd get you
with the double Harrisons.

22 109359 1667
CARTER: Ha-ha-ha.
-You're sick, you know?

23 111194 3169
You think that's sick,
can you name their wives?

24 114572 2418
-No.
-Neither can l.

25 117450 1793
MAN 2: Yo, Cartey-car!
CARTER: Yo!

26 119452 2210
-When they need the Camaro, man?
-Yesterday.

27 121830 1041
MAN 2:
Huh?

28 123039 2210
-All right, I got one for you.
CARTER: All right.

29 125416 2210
Who invented the radio?

30 129254 1125
Ah.

31 130547 1125
That's a hard one.

32 131840 2418
-What do you know, I finally got you.
CARTER: No.

33 134425 2919
I don't know if you want who
they think invented the radio...

34 137512 2335
...or the person who
actually invented the radio.

35 140056 1459
Well, in here it says--

36 141724 1251
Marconi, right?

37 144102 1042
Yeah, it ain't him?

38 145311 2669
He's the one they generally think
invented the radio.

39 148148 4294
In fact, he got a Nobel Prize for it
in 1909.

40 152652 1751
Truth is a guy named Nikola Tesla...

41 154571 3460
...patented the basic idea
for the radio in 1896.

42 158199 3503
Same idea Marconi used for his patent
several years later.

43 161870 1667
[PHONE RINGING]

44 164372 3795
Tesla fought Marconi till
the day he died in 1943.

45 168334 2085
Same year the Supreme Court ruled...

46 170587 2334
...that Marconi's patent was invalid...

47 173089 2835
...recognizing Tesla as
the inventor of the radio.

48 176092 1042
Carter.

49 177677 1417
You really are sick.

50 179304 1917
Oh, hi, Ginnie.

51 181764 3128
Well, good. About time.
What did they say?

52 190064 1793
All right, what does that mean?

53 226851 4754
Kopi Luwak.
The rarest beverage in the world.

54 231981 1709
Take a whiff.

55 233858 1250
Go ahead.

56 235276 1042
[CHAIRMAN CLEARS THROAT]

57 236486 3502
Uh, Mr. Cole, the board is ready
to hear your proposal.

58 240156 2043
Hold on just a second.

59 243618 1959
Go ahead. Go on.

60 252752 1125
Well?

61 255463 4712
Really good.

62 260343 1626
Mr. Cole. Sir?

63 263846 1960
Do you know what a Philistine is, Jim?

64 266557 2335
Sir, it's Richard.

65 269102 3586
That's right, Phil.
Give them the spiel.

66 276609 3378
RICHARD: Thank you, Mr. Chairman,
fellow supervisors.

67 280196 3086
We at the Cole Group feel
the decline of the Winwood Hospital...

68 283449 2877
...is a direct result of significant
fiscal mismanagement.

69 286494 3336
-I beg your pardon, this hospital--
-Overhead costs are nearly double.

70 289998 2751
Your lease and land costs were
similarly overbid.

71 292917 3753
Donations have atrophied to the point
you've fallen far behind the curve...

72 296838 2585
...in Research, Pediatrics,
Oncology and MRI.

73 299632 3961
The Cole Group has privatized 15
public hospitals in seven years...

74 303761 2585
...each of which now provides,
or will soon provide...

75 306514 2919
...the highest standard of medical care
to their communities.

76 309642 3503
-Despite being grossly understaffed?
-The better the doctor, the need--

77 313313 1792
What about beds?
There are rumors...

78 315273 3419
...you increased the number of patients
to the point of overpopulation.

79 318860 1625
Patient density has always been--

80 320653 2502
And your emergency rooms,
I mean, they are known--

81 323364 3503
I run hospitals, not health spas.

82 327076 3503
Two beds to a room, no exceptions.

83 331039 4128
Look, I passed up a lunch
with Michelle Pfeiffer to be here...

84 335376 4879
...so can we desist
from all of this inane posturing?

85 341090 3044
Boys and girls, you need me.

86 344344 2209
I do not need you.

87 347013 3002
Now, there's a sizeable check
in this envelope...

88 350224 3628
...let me know if you decide
to cash it.

89 354020 2084
[COUGHING]

90 358191 1876
Mr. Cole, are you all right?

91 373081 2293
[WOMAN SPEAKING
INDISTINCTLY OVER PA]

92 405863 1209
What are you doing here?

93 407824 3586
Oh, you know,
fighting for my life. You?

94 412203 2001
Uh, no, I was just surprised--

95 414372 2168
EDWARD:
--and I don't care about the insurance!

96 416707 2335
And tell Dr. Shit-for-Brains...

97 419210 4629
...I wanna know everything about this
bleomycin drip he wants to get me on.

98 424048 2293
I hear it eats your lungs.

99 426551 2084
When I address Congress
next month...

100 428803 3210
...I don't want to do it breathing
through a hole in my throat.

101 432223 3211
-That's not exactly what happens.
-Who the hell is this guy?

102 435601 2836
-Where's Thomas? Tom!
-In plain view, sir.

103 439105 2209
-Hi, Tom.
-We're gonna move you into the bed.

104 441482 3294
I can do it myself. I ain't dead yet.

105 444944 1459
[CHUCKLES]

106 447697 1083
[GRUNTS]

107 450741 1376
How about now?

108 456747 1960
Have I fired you lately?

109 458916 1918
Not since the Oprah incident.

110 463588 3377
-That was a good one. Ha-ha-ha.
-Yeah, it's good stuff.

111 474599 1667
Who the hell is that?

112 476476 1500
Who the hell are you?

113 479312 1667
He said, "Who the hell--?"

114 481147 3085
Oh, God. What am I, in the morgue?

115 485109 3461
CARTER: That was the first time
I laid eyes on Edward Cole.

116 489489 2710
An inauspicious beginning, to be sure.

117 492366 2669
EDWARD:
Oh, spare me. Sweet Jesus.

118 495203 2793
I hate these-- I hate tubes!

119 499749 1208
[EDWARD MUTTERS]

120 501125 3920
I'll be damned if I'm gonna spend the
next three weeks laying next to this guy.

121 505213 2918
Zombie boy. Looks half-dead already.

122 508299 4337
You can't have your own room.
It would create an enormous PR problem.

123 512845 2877
I don't give a shit about PR.

124 515890 3336
I want my own room.
It's my hospital, for chrissake.

125 519560 2961
Don't tell me l can't have
my own room.

126 522730 1584
No offense, pal.

127 524482 3836
You have publicly defended this policy
countless times.

128 528486 4336
You run hospitals, not health spas.
Two beds to a room, no exceptions.

129 534951 2751
I've never been sick before.

130 537870 4045
Okay, Dr. Eldridge will be in
in a minute to dot you up, okay?

131 542083 1667
Dot me up.

132 549298 2085
Jesus.

133 556389 1041

134 559058 2585
[WHISPERS]
...don't let me wake up paralyzed.

135 562520 2001
I'll do what I can.

136 570319 1626
This really your hospital?

137 572697 2543
Yeah, pretty much.

138 576951 2710
Might wanna do something
about the pea soup.

139 582415 2334
CARTER:
By the morning of the surgery...

140 584917 3002
...the cancer had spread so far
throughout Edward's body...

141 588087 3419
...that the doctors gave him only
a 5 percent chance to survive...

142 591674 4921
...but then, they didn't account
for how pissed off they'd made him.

143 604729 1750
VIRGINIA:
Mm....

144 608524 2460
No visitors come in to see him?

145 613404 3085
He's been sleeping a lot
since they brought him back.

146 617199 1042
VIRGINIA:
Mm.

147 618576 2918
That's another reason
I don't miss nursing.

148 621662 3628
It's always so sad seeing
a patient like that, all alone...

149 625499 2001
...after that kind of surgery.

150 630630 1667
At least he's quiet.

No, I'm.... I'm fine.

160 686811 1417
Got your meds for the night?

161 688729 1918
Mm-hm. I already took them.

168 738237 2376
She gone?

169 740781 1417
What?

170 743284 4086
As something of a
public health expert...

171 748539 3836
...I believe more people die
from visitors...

172 753002 2251
...than diseases.

Good morning, Edward.

186 794585 2585
-Morning.
-How you feeling?

187 798047 1667
Dumb question.

188 799924 1625
How's that catheter?

189 801759 2543
Don't know how I ever did without it.

190 804470 2543
Ah, humor is a good sign.

191 807431 1834
Kiss my ass.

192 809475 3044
As is surliness.
It's one of your favorite flavors, right?

193 812686 3002
-Yeah.
-Let's see what we got here.

194 815856 1751
It looks good.

195 817775 3294
All right, so the operation
went well, okay?

196 821237 1834
All the post-op brain scans are clean.

197 823239 2293
Now we go after the sarcoma
in the rest of your body.

198 825699 2877
Now, unfortunately,
your blood markers are extremely high...

199 828744 2668
...so I would like to begin chemo
this morning.

200 832248 3294
Love the smell of chemo
in the morning.

201 835751 1793
Apocalypse Now, right?

-All right.

Say, doc? Doc?

206 844844 1959
You think you could just
take a look at--?

207 847012 3461
-Sorry, I'm late. Who's your doctor?
-He's Dr. Gibian.

208 850683 1333
I'll let the nurse know.

209 853561 1542
Appreciate it.

213 867867 2459
-How long you been here?
-Oh.

214 870494 4462
In and out over the past few months.
Got me on an experimental treatment.

215 875124 3627
-What is the quadratic equation?

216 878919 1501
How rough is it?

Chemo?

218 884425 1542
Not too bad.

219 886135 2209
If you don't mind
around-the-clock vomiting...

220 888512 2043
...watching your veins turn black...

221 890723 3210
...and feeling like your bones are
made of napalm...

222 894101 1459
...it's a day at the beach.

223 896186 1793
That's a relief.

224 899106 2502
Of course, I hear people
react to it differently.

225 904904 1542
You'll know by tonight.

226 907114 1542
Tonight?

227 912578 1459
Listen, um...

228 914580 2084
...you don't mind my asking...

229 917458 2376
...what is that contraption
you got over there?

230 920002 3586
It's a siphon. Makes coffee.

231 924882 1417
What else does it do?

232 927259 2418
What else does it have to do?

233 929845 1459
[CARTER CHUCKLES]

234 937227 4045
Did you know that coffee was originally
discovered by a shepherd in Ethiopia?

235 942024 1876
-You don't say.
-It's true.

236 944485 3294
Seems his goats were eating berries
from an unfamiliar bush.

237 947947 2668
Before long, they were running
and jumping all over...

238 950783 1375
...having a gay old time.

239 952660 3669
So the shepherd took some of
the branches to the local monastery...

240 956497 2585
...where the abbots decided
to roast them.

241 959917 1459
When the berries burned...

242 961543 3128
...the beans inside gave off
such a pleasant aroma...

243 964838 1876
...they brewed them into a stew.

244 968759 1751
Stew, huh?

245 970678 5087
And over the next few hundred years,
it spread to Arabia, Europe...

246 976225 2918
...even Sumatra,
like that hooch you got over there.

247 980396 2293
It's called Kopi Luwak.

248 983232 1834
I know what it's called.

249 985442 1834
You do?

250 988529 2084
Never catch me drinking that shit.

251 991031 1918
Have you ever tried it?

252 993617 4253
No. I'm more of a instant-coffee man.

253 998038 2126
Here, here we are.

254 1001375 3085
-Thanks.
-No problem.

255 1007464 1584
There you are.

256 1010718 2751
You always had those freckles?

257 1015014 1709
Far as l know.

258 1017766 1459
Nice...

259 1019393 1626
...freckles.

260 1022354 1084
Hmm.

262 1026400 4295

and melons, some burrata mozzarella...

263 1030904 1960
...and a veal paillard.

264 1033032 3002
The folks at Toscana send their best.

265 1037453 1542
You sure you wanna eat all that?

266 1040205 1709
That's the plan.

268 1044460 1458

269 1047463 1709

270 1049798 2085
You want Thomas
to make you a plate?

271 1052051 3127

First name or last?

274 1059683 1084
First.

275 1061852 2293
Really? Interesting.

276 1065105 3878
So you want, uh--?
Might cheer you up.

277 1069193 1750
No, thanks, I'll pass.

278 1071528 1751
You sure?

279 1076158 1834
Mm, yum, yum.

280 1078202 1750

to me. I'm just, uh, talking to myself.

295 1173463 1501
It's from Kai.

296 1176258 3294
Says he wants to be a mechanic
like his granddad when he grows up.

297 1179720 1709
I hope you talked him out of that.

298 1181597 1584
Well, I tried.

[CARTER CHUCKLES]

302 1191064 2585
-I always wanted one of those.
-Yeah.

303 1193817 2085
-Kai remembered.
-Hmm.

304 1198530 1292
Um....

305 1201241 2835
Mom seems to think
you're not getting enough rest.

306 1205162 1292
Mm-hm.

307 1209708 1417
She loves you, Pop.

308 1212127 1209
Mm-hm.

309 1218592 1500
Okay.

310 1221470 3753
You'll, uh, call us when you get
your test results, huh?

311 1225390 1292
Mm-hm.

312 1227017 1834
If that day ever comes.

313 1229394 1626
Okay.

314 1234233 2334
-Take care.
-Okay.

315 1244451 1793

316 1246411 1334
Yeah.

What's he do?

318 1250374 3294
-Roger's a tax attorney.
-Oh.

Who's the pretty little lady?

322 1268100 3127
That's Rachel. Youngest of the three.

323 1271561 1376
Big age difference.

324 1273105 2626
Yeah, well, she was a surprise.

325 1275899 3503
We'd hardly gotten the boys out
of the house when she came along.

326 1280529 2376
She's an outstanding violinist.

327 1285826 1667
You got kids?

328 1289663 1751
Depends.

329 1292874 3336
-Never stayed married long enough.
-Oh, well...

330 1296420 5212
...don't worry, I've been married
long enough for the both of us.

331 1302134 1542
How's that going?

332 1305929 1584
It's going.

333 1308307 1917

336 1317149 5087
Don't get me wrong, I loved
being married, been there four times.

337 1322404 3252
Problem is I love being single too.

338 1326700 3002
Hard to do them both
at the same time.

339 1330662 3336
Well, nobody's perfect.

340 1334207 3461
Only successful marriage I had
was me and my work.

341 1338045 4086
I started making money
when I was 16...

342 1342799 2085
...and that was that.

343 1345177 1625
Never stopped.

344 1347220 1709
I'll be damned.

345 1351099 2377
I wanted to be a history professor.

[BOTH CHUCKLING]

348 1357731 2585
I made it through two months

349 1360484 2668
...before Virginia gave me the news.

350 1363737 1959
And then, you know...

351 1366865 5087
...young, black, broke,
baby on the way....

352 1373747 2960
Take the first decent job
that comes along.

353 1379795 2084
I always meant to go back...

354 1382547 3336
...but 45 years goes by pretty fast.

358 1425173 5338
Don't give me the morphine
while I'm sleeping. lt's a waste.

359 1431221 3794
Maybe she's trying to kill us both.
You ever think of that?

361 1438311 1876
What are you, the devil?

What if I lost my mind already?

363 1444234 1667
Jesus, no.

364 1446069 4170
No. No, no Jesus,
this is not praying.

365 1450657 3044
I'm talking to myself
out loud, that's....

366 1453869 2710
EDWARD:
You ever think about suicide?

367 1456746 1918
CARTER: Suicide? Me?
EDWARD: Yeah.

368 1458832 1667
Lord, no.

369 1460667 3044
Thought so. Stage one.

370 1464296 1458
What?

371 1466089 2710
The five stages, but....

372 1468967 1083
Denial.

373 1470260 3836
Then anger, bargaining,
depression, acceptance.

374 1474264 4128
So of course you're not
thinking of suicide.

375 1478727 3085
You're in stage one. Denial.

376 1482689 1834
What stage are you in?

377 1485901 1250
Denial.

378 1487319 1584
And thinking about suicide.

379 1489070 2085
Yeah, okay. It's just a frame of....

380 1491323 2668
Well, it looks like you won't be
needing this anymore.

381 1494201 2418
-That's it?
-Yep, fourth and final.

382 1497120 1042
What's next?

383 1498330 2793
They have to run all the tests first,
see where we stand.

384 1501458 2209
-Well, how long?
-Takes a while.

385 1503877 2335
I'll get Dr. Gibian to schedule them
when I see him.

-Yeah.

"No foundation.
All the way down the line."

What are you doing?

402 1555136 1584
Nothing, scribbling.

403 1557931 2001
Scribbling? What?

404 1560433 2252
Nothing. Just scribbling.

405 1565689 3586
Oh, sure,
that's what you wanna do...

406 1569484 4045
...bounce a slider with a man on third.

-Edward?
-Doc.

410 1591047 1292
How's it going there?

411 1592716 1959
Dumb question.

412 1597887 1668
I got the test back.

413 1600682 1667
I'll just lay it out, huh?

414 1604644 1250
Six months.

415 1607147 1959
A year if we're lucky.

416 1610108 3211
There is an experimental program
that we've been conducting...

417 1613486 2001
...and I don't wanna
get your hopes up...

418 1615655 2543
...but I think you would be
an excellent candidate--

419 1618366 1251
Hey, doc.

420 1621077 1292
Yes?

421 1623288 2335
You're blocking my view.

422 1628418 1042
Oh.

423 1629628 1417
Sorry.

424 1633548 1667
Anyway, if there's any questions...

425 1635425 2376
...day or night,
you know where to find me.

426 1638762 1584
One question.

427 1640764 1542
Sure, of course.

428 1643850 3586
Carter, you wanna
ask Dr. Hollins something?

429 1647646 2835
I mean, I'm not familiar
with Mr. Chambers'--

430 1650690 2293
Well, get familiar.

431 1657072 1083
Uh....

432 1658323 3044
I just wanted to know how I stand,
that's all.

433 1661868 3711
Sure. How about I'll go take a look
at your chart, okay?

434 1666331 1542
Thank you.

435 1684391 10301
Edward?

436 1703952 2084
CARTER:
There was a survey once.

437 1706621 3169
A thousand people were asked,
if they could know in advance...

438 1709958 3169
...would they want to know
the exact day of their death.

439 1713294 3086
Ninety-six percent of them said no.

440 1718425 2710
I always kind of leaned toward
the other 4 percent.

441 1722303 2544
I thought it would be liberating...

442 1725014 3128
...knowing how much time
you had left to work with.

443 1728309 1334
HOLLINS:
A year at best.

444 1729811 2376
CARTER:
It turns out, it's not.

445 1732355 2210
HOLLINS:
We're pretty much out of options.

446 1760467 1959
You want to play cards?

447 1763887 2501
Thought you'd never ask.

448 1776691 1834
THOMAS:
Rise and shine.

449 1781571 1709
Or that.

450 1794417 1042
Let me see that.

451 1799047 2001
And, uh, Thomas...

452 1801257 1876
...call Marie at Christie's.

453 1803301 3711
Tell her I won't be bidding
this season.

454 1807889 1667
I understand.

455 1810225 4169
Uh, sir,
I don't mean to sound indelicate...

456 1814771 3586
...but how do you want me
to handle your...?

457 1819150 1584
Death?

458 1822612 2001
Treat it as if it were your own.

459 1825698 3086
So leave all the money
to my assistant?

460 1831621 3544
Go get me one of those
almond croissants that I like.

461 1837001 1960
And don't buy any green bananas.

462 1857355 2502
-What are you doing?
-What is this?

463 1860525 2710
-Come on, give it back.
-What is it?

464 1863403 1417
Give it back.

465 1866114 3335
It was on the floor.
I didn't know it was a state secret.

466 1873329 4003
Well, my freshman
philosophy professor...

467 1877500 3503
...assigned this exercise
in forward thinking.

468 1881170 1626
He called it a "Bucket List."

469 1883381 3503
We were supposed to make a list
of things we wanted to do in our lives...

470 1887093 2001
-...before we--
-Kicked the bucket.

471 1889262 1667
Cutesy.

472 1891097 2668
Anyway, I wrote things like
"make a million dollars"...

473 1893933 4295
..."first black president,"
you know, young man's wishes.

474 1898396 2919
I was gonna redo the list, but then....

475 1901524 3336
"Help a complete stranger
for the good."

476 1905987 2501
"Laugh until I cry."

477 1909115 4003
Not to be judgmental,
but this is extremely weak.

478 1913745 3043
Well, it's pointless now.

479 1917373 4170
I would argue the exact opposite.

480 1922420 2251
All right. That's it.

481 1924839 1042
What are you doing?

482 1926090 2418
A little rewrite, that's all.

483 1928885 3794
I mean, don't you want to go out
with some balls? Guns blazing?

484 1932847 1709
Have a little fun?

485 1934766 3627
It was not supposed to be about
guns blazing or anything like that.

486 1938561 1417
You're missing the point.

487 1940188 3544
What the hell is
"witness something majestic"?

488 1944984 1876
Have you ever been to the Himalayas?

489 1948237 1167
Eh.

490 1949572 2960
"Drive a Mustang Shelby." Not bad.

491 1952700 5129
I got one. All right.
How about skydiving?

492 1959332 1959
Now we're onto something.

493 1961459 1209
We're onto something?

494 1962835 3378
-Uh-huh.
-Let me see that. Come on.

How do you propose doing that?

500 1980561 1084
Volume.

501 1986234 4003
"Get a tattoo."
Is that the sum of your ambition?

502 1991280 2293
Edward, I've taken baths
deeper than you.

503 1994659 3544
It's easy to be deep
in freshman philosophy.

504 1998371 1917
What's Dr. Hollins say?

505 2000498 2251
We got months, right?

506 2002917 1292
A year, maybe.

507 2004419 2918
You think 45 years went by fast?

508 2009465 1793
We could do this.

509 2012010 1583
We should do this.

510 2013803 1042
No, I couldn't.

511 2015013 3794
Don't think about money.
That's all l got is money.

512 2018975 1250
But I don't know. I--

513 2020435 1250
What don't you know?

514 2022061 2335
It was meant to be metaphorical.

515 2024564 3043
-I'm just trying to get a handle on--
-Blah, blah, blah.

516 2027775 1167
Metaphors.

517 2029152 3878
You're the one crying you never
took a shot. Here's your chance.

518 2033239 2752
My chance to what?
Make a fool of myself?

519 2036993 1417
Never too late.

520 2042415 2418
What do you think happens now?

521 2045001 2626
I go back and sit around
listening to people...

522 2047795 4128
...talking about mezzanine financing
and subordinated debt...

523 2052133 2835
...pretending that l care
about dead money.

524 2055344 3712
You go home to some
ceremonial procession into death...

525 2059265 2919
...with everyone standing around
watching you die...

526 2062351 1626
...while you try to comfort them.

527 2064645 4587
Is that what you want,
to be smothered by pity and grief?

528 2069567 1626
Well, not me.

529 2071861 5213
And in your heart, Carter,
I believe not you either.

530 2080328 3753
We're both in the same boat.
How's that for a metaphor?

531 2085666 3336
We got a real opportunity here.

532 2089295 1667
Opportunity?

533 2091130 3127
That is real twisted,
even by your standards.

534 2094467 4420
We still feel good, right?
Energy's coming back a little bit.

535 2099097 2501

we can lay around here...

537 2105103 3877
...hoping for a miracle in
some bullshit science experiment...

538 2109148 4754
...or we can put some moves on.

What did they say?

545 2139971 5588
Uh, Mrs. Chambers, I'm gonna
give you two a little quiet time.

546 2145726 1501
Excuse me.

547 2158614 1292
It's not good.

548 2165872 2459
I knew we should have gone to UCLA.

549 2168499 2168
The surgeons are better.
Post-op is better.

550 2170877 2167
-Wouldn't have mattered.
-You don't know that.

551 2173254 2752
We're not giving up.
I want another opinion.

552 2176174 1417
Ah, Virginia.

553 2177800 2293
Yes, Oncology, please.
Dr. Veteri's office.

554 2180303 1917
Virginia, no.

555 2182555 1667
Let me handle this.

556 2186809 2794
Dr. Veteri? Virginia Chambers.

557 2189770 1835
Yes, that's right--

558 2205870 1959
I'm going away for a while.

559 2208831 1709
What are you talking about?

560 2210750 2751
I'm talking about Edward and I
are going away.

561 2213794 1960
Edward and you?

562 2216255 2293
Going away where?

563 2220343 1959
I don't expect you to understand.

564 2222762 3169
You're damn right I don't understand.

565 2226098 3128
I don't understand how you can
just give up like this.

566 2229393 2585
How you can just quit--
Quit fighting.

567 2232188 2460
-Virginia.
-Why don't you tell our children that?

568 2234857 3419
See what they say when they find out
you've given up on them.

569 2238486 4587
Given up on them?

570 2243824 2961
I've got 45 years greased up
under the hood of a car...

571 2246953 3669
...so that they didn't want for anything,
and they didn't.

572 2250790 2293
I think I've earned some time
for myself.

573 2253292 3753
To do what?
Run off with a total stranger?

574 2257255 1333
He's not a stranger.

575 2258798 1375
I'm your wife.

576 2260383 2293
And l'm your husband.
And l'm their father.

577 2262843 2627
And l'm a grandfather.
And l'm a damn mechanic!

578 2265680 1166
And you're a fool.

579 2267348 4128
You're a fool who thinks he's figured out
a way how not to have cancer.

580 2277400 1709
I'm sorry.

581 2289745 2544
My husband is not for sale.

582 2306095 1959
She hates me.

583 2313060 1876
Do you hate me?

584 2317148 1584
Not yet.

And so it began.

586 2341339 2459
I've always been afraid to go up
in an airplane...

587 2344008 3586
...now l'm gonna jump out of one
at the whim of a maniac!

588 2349597 1375
Wanna get it?

589 2351640 2377
How do you suggest we do that?

590 2354435 1042
Wait.

591 2355728 1083
Ow!

592 2362443 1083
Aah!

593 2363694 1459
Damn it.

594 2370785 1709
Not a word.

595 2374288 2085
Back to the seat, Kyle.

596 2376582 4754
You'll have to forgive him, Kyle.
He's worried about the little woman.

597 2381545 2502
This has nothing to do with my wife.

598 2384256 1376
Thirty seconds to drop.

599 2385841 2252
The Sequel was like that.

600 2388260 2544
She never backed me up on anything.

601 2391013 1125
The Sequel?

602 2392348 2376
The second Mrs. Edward Cole.

603 2395726 2460
God, that woman hated me.

604 2398396 2167
Maybe because you called her
The Sequel.

605 2401190 4170
Jeez, Kyle,
I never looked at it that way.

606 2405528 1876
-Fifteen seconds.
CARTER: No, no.

607 2407613 2585
-Wait! Wait, I can't do this.
-Sure you can.

608 2410408 2418
CARTER:
No. I can't. Really.

609 2413035 1876
It's not the jump you're afraid of.

610 2415121 1417
The hell it's not!

611 2416747 2335
You're just afraid
your chute won't open...

612 2419250 4461
...and you'll show up at
your own funeral as a Denver omelet.

613 2423921 3252
No, I'm pretty much just worried
the chute won't open.

614 2427341 1167
No, no!

626 2463419 2251
Which one of these damn cords
do you pull?

You're so close.

639 2506712 2210
Let me ask you something.

640 2509089 2419
Uh, is it Tommy or Thomas?

641 2511675 3878
Um, it's actually Matthew,
but he finds that too biblical.

Let's eat something. Come on!

Is he insane?

Depends.

[EDWARD GASPS]

646 2525898 1792
So you decided?

647 2527858 4003
No, I couldn't think of anything
I wanted to be stuck with permanently.

648 2532029 3461
What's permanently?
We're gonna be dead in five minutes.

649 2535658 2918
-What?
-Figure of speech.

650 2538744 4629
So no Confederate flag,
no black Jesus.

651 2543582 1584
No, I'm gonna....

652 2545376 1876
Pass. Yeah, sure.

653 2547461 2168
Well, I never agreed
to desecrate my body.

654 2549838 2585
You worried they won't bury you
in a Jewish cemetery?

655 2553133 1501
What, the wife?

656 2554802 1542
It's a tattoo.

657 2556554 2584
It's not like you're dumping her
for another woman.

658 2559848 1876
I never been with another woman.

659 2562309 1084
Whoa.

660 2564645 2335
That's gotta be on the list.

No, no. I don't think so.

Sixty-six years?

We ought to have a big orgy.

No.

Orgy's not even being unfaithful.

-Ha, ha.

Just getting to know each other.

674 2610941 2251
You sure we're cleared for this?

675 2613402 3920
Of course we're cleared for it.
What if we weren't?

Come on! Tap it, baby!
Let's see what she's got.

Ah, we're doing just fine.

You sound like some kid
going to the junior prom.

680 2651940 2711
You sound like someone looking
for an ass-whupping.

of some sort did all this?

712 2872202 1417
You don't?

713 2873829 4003
You mean, do I believe
if l look up in the sky...

714 2878000 2334
...and promise this or that...

715 2880502 3878
...the Biggie will make all this
go away?

716 2885007 1041
No.

717 2886508 2877
Then 95 percent of the people on Earth
are wrong?

718 2889595 1959
If life has taught me anything...

719 2891722 3252
...it's that 95 percent of the people
are always wrong.

720 2895183 1584
It's called faith.

I honestly envy people who have faith.
I just can't get my head around it.

722 2902983 2168
Maybe your head's in the way.

723 2907529 3711
Carter, we've all had hundreds
of these discussions...

724 2911408 3878
...and every one of them
always hits the same wall.

725 2915454 4879
Is there a sugarplum fairy or not?

726 2920500 3753
And nobody has ever gotten
over that wall.

727 2924796 2919
So, what do you believe?

I resist all beliefs.

go round and round.

I'd love to be wrong.

735 2951949 3585
If I'm wrong, I win.

something I don't.

After the breakup,
and the ensuing fleecing of the dad...

...Emily went to live with her mother.

928 3685640 4128
...Emily goes to college, joins one
of her "Save the Poor People"...

929 3689936 2293
...the animals, whatnot...

930 3692397 2334
...meets a guy, decides she loves him.

931 3695441 3294
Good-looking kid, driven, smart.

932 3703116 3085
But there was something about him...

933 3706369 3336
...so when she said they were engaged
I told her I was against it...

934 3709872 2669
...but being my daughter, naturally...

935 3713334 2168
...she went ahead
and married him anyway.

Needless to say,
I wasn't invited to the wedding.

That must have hurt.

939 3728349 5088
First time he hit her, she came to me.
I wanted to bash his brains in.

940 3734021 1543
She wouldn't let me.

941 3735732 3669
Said she loved him, said it wasn't
his fault, he'd had a few drinks...

who handles these kinds of things.

I don't know what he said,
don't know what he did...

950 3769682 2460
...all I know is he didn't kill him...

951 3772310 4086
...and my daughter never
heard from him again.

952 3778065 1960
How did she react?

953 3781861 4045
Called me names you wouldn't believe,
and worse....

954 3787158 2251
Said I was dead to her.

955 3794791 2876
I'm not proud of everything I did...

956 3797835 2669
...but I'm pretty sure
I'd do it all again...

957 3800671 4546
...so if they don't let me into Egyptian
heaven because my daughter hates me...

958 3805384 3753

just the way it goes.

...and remained inseparable until
she died giving birth to their 14th child.

What do you do with the ashes?

984 3934639 2751

put them on a shelf?

1067 4239652 2626
There's not enough air
to reflect the sunlight.

1068 4243030 5004
But at night,
you've never seen so many stars.

1069 4248869 4837
Seems like they're just out of reach,
and so bright.

1070 4254124 4879
They're like little holes
in the floor of heaven.

1071 4266470 2794
-Did you hear it?
-Hear what?

1072 4270975 3502
I read an account of a man
who made it to the summit...

1073 4275354 4086
...and standing there
at the top of the world...

1074 4280442 3837
...he experienced
this profound silence.

1075 4284655 3336
It was like all sound just fell away.

1076 4288993 1542
And that's when he heard it.

1077 4290953 1125
What?

1078 4293414 2167
The sound of the mountain.

1079 4297668 3586
He said it was like he heard
the voice of God.

1080 4308053 2168
I've never done this before.

1081 4311724 3377
That sounds like such a cliché...

1082 4317730 2585
...but I have a room upstairs.

1083 4327448 1584
Well, that's....

1084 4331577 1625
I mean....

1085 4333620 1376
I....

1086 4338792 2210
I appreciate that.

1087 4342129 1709
But you see....

1088 4348677 1959
She's a very lucky woman.

1089 4350846 3085
Well, I rather think I'm the lucky one.

1090 4354516 1793
Good for you.

1091 4369531 1417
Tom?

1092 4371700 3503
Three things to remember
when you get older:

1093 4375371 1667
Never pass up a bathroom...

1094 4377247 4170
...never waste a hard-on,
and never trust a fart.

1095 4381627 3794
I'll keep that in mind
as I approach decrepitude.

1096 4385589 2210
Heh-heh. That's a good one there.

1097 4388425 1417
Let's go home.

1098 4390052 1208
Excuse me?

1099 4391428 2251
I want to go home now.

1100 4393847 3169
But I thought that--
What about the silk suits?

1101 4397476 1918
That was very clever of you, Edward.

1102 4401271 1292
[LAUGHS]

1103 4402773 2251
How'd you know
I wouldn't go through with it?

1104 4406402 1667
I didn't.

1105 4417454 1834
I'm proud of you.

1106 4420082 2710

Hey, Tommy, this isn't
the way to Crenshaw.

1110 4470716 3419
There's an accident on the 10.
We're taking the surface streets.

1111 4474303 1458
Uh-huh.

1112 4489902 1959
Why are we, uh...?

1113 4496366 1876
Oh, my God.

1114 4498410 3252
He's kept tabs on her.
Just in case you decided to--

1115 4501830 1668
This was your idea, Tom?

1116 4503665 2252
No, it was my idea.
I talked him into it.

1117 4506084 2085
-Yeah, talked him into it.
-Hey.

1118 4508378 2836
Wait a minute. Edward. Edward?
Wait a minute.

1119 4511381 2669
Edward. What are you so afraid of?

1120 4514218 4503
Just because I told you my story
does not invite you to be a part of it.

1121 4518889 1626
Oh. Like the lady in the bar?

1122 4520724 1959
-That's different.
-Tell me how.

1123 4523268 2126
-Because it is!
-How is it different?

1124 4525604 3377
You have no fucking idea who I am!

up from nothing!

supposed to make out like, what...

1128 4538575 2669
...this trip was supposed to
mean something to me?

1129 4541411 2836
Like it was gonna change me?

1130 4546416 4087
How did you see it playing out, Carter?
I knock on the door, she answers.

1131 4550671 1792
She's surprised and angry...

1132 4552673 3168
...but I tell her how much l love her
and miss her.

1133 4556009 2877
And, "Oh. By the way,
I'm gonna be dead soon...

1134 4559054 3127
...so I'm reaching out to you
because l don't wanna die alone"?

1135 4562391 1584
Everyone is afraid to die alone.

1136 4564184 2418
I'm not everyone!

This was supposed to be fun.

"Kopi Luwak is the world's
most expensive coffee.

1220 5053048 5212
Though for some, it falls under
the category of 'too good to be true.'

1221 5058428 3044
In the Sumatran village
where the beans are grown...

1222 5061639 2752
...lives a breed of wild tree cat.

1223 5064601 4837
These cats eat the beans,
digest them and then...

1224 5069606 1834
...defecate.

1225 5073193 4545
The villagers then collect
and process the stools.

1226 5077906 4420
It is the combination of the beans
and the gastric juices of the tree cat...

1227 5082494 4420
...that give Kopi Luwak
its unique flavor...

1228 5087082 1917
...and aroma."

1236 5154649 2293
It's not a one-man deal.

CARTER: Dear Edward, I've gone
back and forth the last few days...

1242 5245198 3335
...trying to decide whether or not
I should even write this.

1243 5249577 4962
In the end, I realized
I would regret it if I didn't...

1244 5254707 2168
...so here goes.

1245 5257877 2001
I know the last time
we saw each other...

1246 5260046 3085
...we weren't exactly hitting
the sweetest notes.

1247 5263299 3211
It certainly wasn't the way
I wanted the trip to end.

1248 5268638 5046
I suppose I'm responsible,
and for that I'm sorry.

1249 5274936 3961
But, in all honesty,
if I had the chance, I'd do it again.

1250 5283027 4003
Virginia said I left a stranger
and came back a husband.

1251 5287991 2126
I owe that to you.

1252 5291953 3669
There's no way I can repay you
for all you've done for me...

1253 5295790 5796
...so rather than try, I'm just going to
ask you to do something else for me.

1254 5302380 2501
Find the joy in your life.

1255 5307093 2585
You once said you're not everyone.

1256 5309846 2460
Well, that's true.

1257 5312473 2460
You're certainly not everyone.

1258 5315476 3795
But everyone is everyone.

1259 5322025 1959
My pastor always says:

1260 5324527 2543
"Our lives are streams...

1261 5327488 1960
...flowing into the same river...

1262 5329615 4421
...towards whatever heaven lies
in the mist beyond the falls."

1263 5334203 3419
Hello, sweetie. Hi.

1264 5337790 2794
CARTER:
Find the joy in your life, Edward.

1265 5346841 1918
My dear friend...

1266 5349385 5338
...close your eyes
and let the waters take you home.

1267 5357435 4545
Good afternoon.
My name is Edward Cole.

1268 5364901 5087
I don't know what most people say
at these occasions, because...

1269 5370448 2501
...in all honesty, I....

1270 5374243 2961
I've tried to avoid them.

1271 5381209 2459
The simplest thing is...

1272 5383836 4128
...I loved him and I miss him.

1273 5393221 3127
Carter and I saw the world together.

1274 5398101 2126
Which is amazing...

1275 5400395 2710
...when you think that only
three months ago...

1276 5403272 2836
...we were complete strangers.

1277 5411239 1834
I hope...

1278 5414575 3419
...that it doesn't sound
selfish of me...

1279 5418162 4254
...but the last months of his life...

1280 5422583 3294
...were the best months of mine.

1281 5428381 1709
He saved my life.

1282 5431134 3085
And he knew it before I did.

1283 5437098 4337
EDWARD:
I'm deeply proud that this man...

1284 5441602 4420
...found it worth his while
to know me.

1285 5447733 1960
In the end...

1286 5449861 5713
...I think it's safe to say that we brought
some joy to one another's lives.

1287 5455908 3044
So, one day, when...

1288 5459662 3419
...I go to some final resting place...

1289 5463958 4504
...if I happen to wake up
next to a certain wall with a gate...

1290 5468629 3211
...I hope that Carter's there...

1291 5472008 2209
...to vouch for me...

1292 5474427 3002
...and show me the ropes
on the other side.

1293 5484061 2836
CARTER:
Edward Perriman Cole died in May.

1294 5488065 2794
It was a Sunday, in the afternoon...

1295 5491027 3377
...and there wasn't a cloud in the sky.

1296 5494572 2084
He was 81 years old.

1297 5498868 4337
Even now, I can't claim to understand
the measure of a life.

1298 5503998 2585
But I can tell you this:

1299 5507168 4337
I know that when he died,
his eyes were closed...

1300 5512256 2585
...and his heart was open.

1301 5516260 4379
And I'm pretty sure he was happy
with his final resting place...

1302 5521432 3294
...because he was buried
on the mountain...

1303 5525728 2794
...and that was against the law.

1304 5820397 2001
[THE END]
