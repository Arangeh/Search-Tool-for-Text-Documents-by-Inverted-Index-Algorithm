1 16683 2335
Did you know there are more people
with genius IQs living in China

2 19102 2043
than there are people of any kind
living in the United States?

3 21229 1793
- That can't possibly be true.
- It is.

4 23106 1042
What would account for that?

5 24232 3002
Well, first, an awful lot of people
live in China, but here's my question.

6 27318 2127
How do you distinguish yourself
in a population of people

7 29529 1834
who all got 1600 on their SATs?

8 31448 1792
- I didn't know they take SATs in China.
- They don't.

9 33324 2127
I wasn't talking about China anymore,
I was talking about me.

10 35535 1459
You got a 1600?

11 37078 1834
Yes. I could sing in an a cappella group,
but I can't sing.

12 38997 1208
Does that mean you actually
got nothing wrong?

13 40290 2293
I could row crew or invent a $25 PC.

14 42667 1250
Or you could get into a final club.

15 44002 1333
Or I get into a final club.

16 45628 1209
You know, from a woman's perspective,

17 46921 1876
sometimes not singing in
an a cappella group is a good thing.

18 48882 1041
This is serious.

19 50008 1459
On the other hand,
I do like guys who row crew.

20 51551 1876
Well, I can't do that.

21 53720 1375
I was kidding.

22 55180 1166
And, yes, I got nothing wrong on the test.

23 56431 1792
- Have you ever tried?
- I'm trying right now.

24 58308 1834
- To row crew?
- To get into a final club.

25 60226 2252
To row crew? No.
Are you, like, whatever, delusional?

26 62562 1959
Maybe it's just sometimes
you say two things at once.

27 64606 1542
I'm not sure which one
I'm supposed to be aiming at.

28 66232 1918
But you've seen guys who row crew, right?

29 68234 1042
No.

30 69360 2085
Okay, well, they're bigger than me.
They're world-class athletes.

31 71529 1459
And a second ago,
you said you like guys who row crew

32 73073 1041
so I assumed you had met one.

33 74199 4003
I guess I just meant I like the idea of it.
You know, the way a girl likes cowboys.

34 78745 1042
Okay.

35 80246 1084
Should we get something to eat?

36 81414 1793
Would you like to talk
about something else?

37 83500 3210
No. It's just since the beginning of
the conversation about finals club,

38 86795 1875
I think I may have missed a birthday.

39 89464 3169
There are really more people in China with
genius IQs than the entire population...

40 92717 3336
The Phoenix is the most diverse.
The Fly Club... Roosevelt punched the Porc.

41 96137 1084
Which one?

42 97305 1501
The Porcellian, the Porc.
It's the best of the best.

43 98890 1751
- Which Roosevelt?
- Theodore.

44 102060 2001
Is it true that they send a bus around
to pick up girls

45 104145 1459
who want to party with
the next Fed chairman?

46 105688 2710
So you can see why
it's so important to get in.

47 108483 1542
Okay, well, which is the easiest to get into?

48 112529 2876
- Why would you ask me that?
- I was just asking.

49 115490 2168
None of them. That's the point.

50 117742 2919
My friend Eduardo made $300,000
betting oil futures one summer

51 120745 1334
and Eduardo won't come close to getting in.

52 122163 1960
The ability to make money doesn't
impress anybody around here.

53 124207 3252
Must be nice.
He made $300,000 in a summer?

54 127544 2334
- He likes meteorology.
- You said it was oil futures.

55 129963 2209
You can read the weather,
you can predict the price of heating oil.

56 132257 1083
I think you asked me that

57 133424 1793
because you think
the final club that's easiest to get into

58 135301 1251
is the one where I'll have the best chance.

59 136636 2335
I... What?

60 139055 1542
You asked me which one was
the easiest to get into

61 140682 2501
because you think that that's the one
where I'll have the best chance.

62 143268 2501
The one that's the easiest to get into
would be the one

63 145854 1166
where anybody has the best chance.

64 147105 1584
You didn't ask me which one
was the best one,

65 148773 1459
you asked me which one
was the easiest one.

66 150483 3419
I was honestly just asking, okay?
I was just asking to ask.

67 153987 2376
- Mark, I'm not speaking in code.
- Erica.

68 156906 1876
You're obsessed with finals clubs.

69 158867 2376
You have finals clubs OCD
and you need to see someone about it

70 161327 1668
who will prescribe you
some sort of medication.

71 163079 2502
You don't care if the side effects
may include blindness.

72 165707 2668
Final clubs. Not "finals clubs."

73 169669 2502
And there's a difference between
being obsessed and being motivated.

74 172255 2835
Yes. There is.

75 175175 1667
Well, you do.
That was cryptic, so you do speak in code.

76 176926 1251
I didn't mean to be cryptic.

77 178261 1751
I'm just saying I need to do
something substantial

78 180096 1834
in order to get the attention of the clubs.

79 182015 1750
- Why?
- Because they're exclusive.

80 184517 1751
And fun, and they lead to a better life.

81 186394 1542
Teddy Roosevelt didn't get elected president

82 188021 1917
because he was a member
of the Phoenix Club.

83 190064 2210
He was a member of the Porcellian,
and yes, he did.

84 192400 3336
Well, why don't you just concentrate
on being the best you you can be?

85 196362 1000
Did you really just say that?

86 197447 1500
I was kidding.

87 199032 1667
Just because something's trite
doesn't make it less true.

88 200783 1084
I wanna try to be straightforward with you

89 201951 2252
and tell you I think you might
want to be a little more supportive.

90 204287 3586
If I get in, I will be taking you
to the events and the gatherings,

91 207957 3169
and you'll be meeting a lot of people
you wouldn't normally get to meet.

92 212295 1417
You would do that for me?

93 214380 1376
We're dating.

94 215965 1251
Okay.

95 218927 1542
Well, I wanna try and be
straightforward with you

96 220595 1792
and let you know that we're not anymore.

97 222472 2501
- What do you mean?
- We're not dating anymore. I'm sorry.

98 225099 2043
- Is this a joke?
- No, it's not.

99 227227 1000
You're breaking up with me?

100 228311 1250
You're gonna introduce me to people

101 229646 1667
I wouldn't normally
have the chance to meet?

102 231439 1793
What the... What is that supposed to mean?

103 233316 1250
- Wait, settle down.
- What is it supposed to mean?

104 234651 1834
Erica, the reason we're able to sit here
and drink right now

105 236611 1709
is 'cause you used to sleep
with the door guy.

106 239405 3670
"The door guy"? His name is Bobby.
I have not slept with the door guy.

107 243159 4420
The door guy is a friend of mine,
and he's a perfectly good class of people.

108 247664 2501
And what part of Long Island
are you from, Wimbledon?

109 250291 2210
- Wait. Wait, wait.
- I'm going back to my dorm.

110 252627 1292
- Is this real?
- Yes.

111 254003 2001
- Then wait, I apologize, okay?
- I have to go study.

112 256130 1292
- Erica?
- Yes?

113 257507 2251
- I'm sorry, I mean it.
- I appreciate that, but I have to go study.

114 259842 2252
Come on, you don't have to study.
Let's just talk.

115 262178 1250
- I can't.
- Why?

116 263513 2918
Because it is exhausting.
Dating you is like dating a StairMaster.

117 266516 2168
All I meant is that you're not likely to...
Currently...

118 268810 1125
I wasn't making a comment
on your appearance.

119 270019 2168
I was saying that you go to BU.
I was stating a fact, that's all,

120 272313 1042
and if it seemed rude, then I apologize.

121 273439 1334
- I have to go study.
- You don't have to study.

122 274857 1334
Why do you keep saying
I don't have to study?

123 276276 1834
'Cause you go to BU.

124 280196 1459
Do you want to get some food?

125 282365 2835
I am sorry you are not sufficiently
impressed with my education.

126 285660 1542
And I'm sorry I don't have a rowboat,
so we're even.

127 287328 2710
- I think we should just be friends.
- I don't want friends.

128 290164 1042
I was just being polite.

129 291291 1166
I have no intention
of being friends with you.

130 292542 2084
I'm under some pressure right now
from my OS class

131 294711 2585
and if we could just order some food,
I think we should...

132 297672 4378
Okay, you are probably going to be
a very successful computer person.

133 302635 2502
But you're gonna go through life
thinking that girls don't like you

134 305221 1667
because you're a nerd.

135 307640 2919
And I want you to know from the bottom
of my heart that that won't be true.

136 312061 2627
It'll be because you're an asshole.

137 497413 1375
Erica Albright's a bitch.

138 498915 2501
Do you think that's because her family
changed their name from Albrecht,

139 501542 3211
or do you think it's because
all BU girls are bitches?

140 509091 2043
For the record, she may look like a 34C,

141 511260 2627
but she's getting all kinds of help
from our friends at Victoria's Secret.

142 513971 4087
She's a 34B, as in barely anDhing there.
False advertising.

143 522146 1751
The truth is, she has a nice face.

144 523981 2293
I need to do something
to take my mind off her.

145 526400 2544
Easy enough, except I need an idea.

146 535117 2127
I'm a little intoxicated, I'm not gonna lie.

147 537328 1918
So what if it's not even 10:00 p.m.
And it's a Tuesday night?

148 539330 1042
Billy.

149 540456 1751
The Kirkland facebook
is open on my desktop,

150 542291 2669
and some of these people have
pretty horrendous facebook pics.

151 545962 2668
Billy Olson's sitting here and had
the idea of putting some of the pictures

152 548756 3211
next to pictures of farm animals
and have people vote on who's hotter.

153 552093 1542
Good call, Mr. Olson.

154 560434 2585
Yeah, it's on.
I'm not gonna do the farm animals,

155 563104 1834
but I like the idea of comparing
two people together.

156 565022 1501
It gives the whole thing a very "Turing" feel

157 566649 1918
since people's ratings of the pictures
will be more implicit

158 568651 2543
than, say, choosing a number to
represent each person's hotness,

159 571320 1668
like they do on hotornot. Com.

160 573114 2501
The first thing we're going to need
is a lot of pictures.

161 575700 2209
Unfortunately, Harvard doesn't keep
a public centralized facebook,

162 577994 1041
so I'm going to have to get all the images

163 579161 1626
from the individual houses
that people are in.

164 582331 1292
Let the hacking begin.

165 599682 1000
First up is Kirkland.

166 600808 2960
They keep everything open and allow
indexes in their Apache configuration.

167 603853 4545
So a little Wget magic is all that's necessary
to download the entire Kirkland facebook.

168 608524 1000
Kids' stuff.

169 627043 1000
Next is Eliot.

170 628169 2084
They're also open,
but with no indexes on Apache.

171 630379 1000
I can run an empty search

172 631505 2335
and it returns all of the images
in the database in a single page.

173 633924 3294
And I can save the page and Mozilla
will save all the images for me.

174 637345 1583
Excellent. Moving right along.

175 639388 2085
Excuse me! Everybody!

176 641557 3419
You are at one of the oldest,
one of the most exclusive clubs,

177 645061 2793
not just at Harvard, but in the world.

178 648230 1000
And I want to welcome you all

179 649357 3377
to Phoenix Club's first party
of the fall semester!

180 659867 2668
Lowell has some security.
They require a user name/password combo,

181 662620 3169
and I'm gonna go ahead and say they don't
have access to the main FAS user database,

182 665915 1167
so they have no way
of detecting an intrusion.

183 668250 3753
Adams has no security, but limits
the number of results to 20 a page.

184 672088 3085
All I need to do is break out the same script
I used on Lowell and we're set.

185 676759 2001
Quincy has no online facebook.
What a sham.

186 679095 1041
Nothing I can do about that.

187 681597 1042
Dunster is intense.

188 682765 2668
Not only is there no public directory,
but there's no directory at all.

189 685518 1041
You have to do searches,

190 686644 2585
and if your search returns more
than 20 matches, nothing gets returned.

191 689313 2251
And once you do get results,
they don't link directly to the images.

192 691649 2585
They link to a PHP that redirects
or something. Weird.

193 694318 1459
This may be difficult. I'll come back later.

194 695861 1793
- Hey, Shark Week's on.
- What?

195 698280 2127
- Great white, beautiful fish.
- Nice.

196 700491 1667
Leverett is a little better.
They still make you search,

197 702284 3086
but you can do an empty search and get
links to pages with every student's picture.

198 705454 2669
It's slightly obnoxious that they
only let you view one picture at a time,

199 708207 2877
and there's no way I'm going to go
to 500 pages to download pics one at a time.

200 711168 3378
So it's definitely necessary to break out
Emacs and modify that Perl script.

201 725224 1459
Here you go.

202 731856 1125
Done.

203 733357 1793
Hey, what's going on?

204 735234 3669
Perfect timing. Eduardo's here
and he's going to have the key ingredient.

205 738988 1625
- Hey, Mark.
- Wardo.

206 740698 2001
You and Erica split up.

207 742825 1042
How did you know that?

208 743993 1500
It's on your blog.

209 746495 1626
- Yeah.
- Are you all right?

210 748205 2335
- I need you.
- I'm here for you.

211 750750 1917
No, I need the algorithm you use
to rank chess players.

212 752752 2251
- Are you okay?
- We're ranking girls.

213 757381 2001
- You mean other students.
- Yeah.

214 759508 1668
You think this is such a good idea?

215 761385 1376
- I need the algorithm.
- Mark...

216 762845 1834
I need the algorithm.

217 766015 2334
Give each girl a base rating of 1400.

218 768434 4462
At any given time Girl A has a rating R-a
and Girl B has a rating R-b.

219 773022 2710
When any two girls are matched up,
there's an expectation of which will win

220 775858 1083
based on their current rating, right?

221 777026 3502
Yeah. And those expectations
are expressed this way.

222 780696 1334
Let's write it.

223 796921 1709
One on the left.

224 799089 1334
The right.

225 800549 1376
Yeah, still the right.

226 802051 1792
- It works.
- Who should we send it to first?

227 803928 1041
- Dwyer.
- Neal.

228 805054 3085
- Who are you gonna send it to?
- Just a couple of people.

229 808265 1125
The question is,

230 809642 2418
who are they gonna send it to?

231 841090 1375
Hey, guys, check this out.

232 844802 1834
Someone go to the left. Dude, do left.

233 846762 2502
Look at these girls. Right or left?

234 849348 2251
- Left is hot.
- Left? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

235 852852 1542
Right or left?

236 854478 1793
That's my roommate.

237 856355 1918
- Oh, my God.
- The girl on the left.

238 859775 1584
This is pathetic.

239 861443 1042
Right.

240 862611 1167
Left.

241 864363 1083
- Left.
- Left?

242 866532 1334
Oh, shit.

243 868701 1333
Albright.

244 871287 1208
He blogged about you.

245 873163 1710
You don't wanna read it.

246 878836 1167
Left.

247 880462 1126
Latina.

248 881672 1209
Erica.

249 883674 1542
Is this yours?

250 885301 1458
I stole it from a tranny.

251 886844 2043
Get the hell out of here!

252 889555 2001
- Left.
- One on the right.

253 891640 1501
Left.

254 899690 2627
Man, that's an awful lot of traffic.

255 903235 3503
You think maybe we shouldn't shut it down
before we get into trouble?

256 915581 1208
Hello?

257 918584 2335
Wait, wait, wait, wait. What?

258 921837 1042
At 4:00 in the morning?

259 922963 3127
Well, there's a very unusual amount
of traffic to the switch at Kirkland.

260 926383 2252
You're saying it's unusual
for 4:00 in the morning?

261 928719 3085
No, this'd be unusual
for halftime at the Super Bowl.

262 932473 1375
All right.

263 936560 1584
I gotta go in.

264 938604 1667
What's going on?

265 940356 2626
Harvard's network is about to crash.

266 949156 1125
You don't think...

267 952409 1167
I do.

268 954328 2168
Go see if it's everybody's.

269 962044 1375
I can't connect.

270 964588 1793
The network's down.

271 967383 1750
Unless it's a coincidence, I think this is us.

272 969218 1459
It's not a coincidence.

273 971095 1542
Holy shit.

274 976934 1542
So you were called in front of the Ad Board.

275 978560 1668
That's not what happened.

276 980312 1626
You weren't called in front
of the Administrative Board?

277 982022 3753
No, back. I mean back at the bar
with Erica Albright. She said all that?

278 985859 1626
- Mark...
- That I said that stuff to her?

279 987569 1668
I was reading from the transcript
of her deposition.

280 989321 1668
Yeah, why would you even need
to depose her?

281 991073 1667
That's really for us to decide.

282 992825 3544
You think if I know she can make me
look like a jerk, I'll be more likely to settle.

283 996453 1417
Why don't we stretch our legs for a minute?

284 997955 1751
Can we do that?
It's been almost three hours.

285 999790 3669
And frankly, you did spend an awful lot
of time embarrassing Mr. Zuckerberg

286 1003544 1834
with the girl's testimony from the bar.

287 1005462 1626
I'm not embarrassed,
she just made a lot of that up.

288 1007172 1084
She was under oath.

289 1008340 2377
Then I guess that would be the first time
somebody's lied under oath.

290 1021562 2960
The site got 2,200 hits within two hours?

291 1024940 1042
Thousand.

292 1026066 1167
What?

293 1028360 1834
Twenty-two thousand.

294 1032489 1125
Wow.

295 1050507 2377
These guys are just freakin' fast.

296 1058223 2794
Is there any way to make this a fair fight?

297 1061101 1751
Jump out and swim.

298 1063312 2168
I think we'd have to jump out and drown.

299 1065564 3044
Well, you could row forward
and I could row backward.

300 1068692 3252
We're genetically identical.
Science says we'd stay in one place.

301 1072029 1083
Just row the damn boat.

302 1081121 1834
- You guys hear about this?
- What?

303 1083040 3627
Two nights ago, a sophomore choked
the network from a laptop at Kirkland.

304 1086752 1500
- Really?
- At 4:00 a.m.

305 1088796 1041
How?

306 1089922 3043
He set up a website where you vote
on the hotness of female undergrads.

307 1093467 1417
What were we doing
that none of us heard about this?

308 1094968 1042
I don't know.

309 1096095 2543
A three-hour low-rate
technical row before breakfast.

310 1098722 1459
Full course load. Studying.

311 1100265 2293
Another three hours in the tank
and then studying.

312 1102643 1208
I'm not sure how we missed it.

313 1103936 1625
How much activity was there on this thing?

314 1105687 1751
Twenty-two thousand page requests.

315 1108315 1042
Twenty-two thousand?

316 1109441 2460
Cam, this guy hacked
the facebook of seven houses.

317 1111985 2669
He set up the whole website in one night,
and he did it while he was drunk.

318 1114738 1167
Twenty-two thousand?

319 1116490 2918
- Well, how do you know he was drunk?
- He was blogging simultaneously.

320 1120494 2668
- You know what I think?
- Way ahead of you.

321 1123247 1667
This is our guy.

322 1125624 1292
Cameron Winklevoss.

323 1127000 3211
W-l-N-K-L-E-V-O-S-S.

324 1130295 1292
"Cameron" spelled the usual way.

325 1131672 1584
Tyler Winklevoss.

326 1133340 3336
Tyler spelled the usual way, and my
last name is the same as my brother's.

327 1136844 3627
Mr. Zuckerberg, this is
an Administrative Board hearing.

328 1140889 2877
You're being accused
of intentionally breaching security,

329 1143851 1417
violating copyrights,

330 1145352 5296
violating individual privacy
by creating the website www.facemash.com.

331 1150983 2543
You're also charged with
being in violation of university policy,

332 1153610 2210
on distribution of digitized images.

333 1155904 3044
Before we begin with our questioning,
you're allowed to make a statement.

334 1159032 1209
Would you like to do so?

335 1161160 1125
I...

336 1163370 4629
You know, I've already apologized
in The Crimson to the ABHW,

337 1168083 1584
to Fuerza Latina,

338 1169751 2335
and to any women at Harvard
who may have been insulted,

339 1172171 2251
as I take it that they were.

340 1175132 2251
As for any charges stemming
from the breach of security,

341 1177467 2877
I believe I deserve
some recognition from this board.

342 1182806 1667
- I'm sorry?
- Yes.

343 1185350 1209
I don't understand.

344 1186643 1042
Which part?

345 1188187 1667
You deserve recognition?

346 1190439 2626
I believe I've pointed out
some pretty gaping holes in your system.

347 1193150 2001
- Excuse me, may I?
- Yes.

348 1196236 1417
Mr. Zuckerberg,

349 1197738 3210
I'm in charge of security
for all computers on the Harvard network,

350 1201033 2418
and I can assure you of its sophistication.

351 1203535 3586
In fact, it was that level of sophistication
that led us to you in less than four hours.

352 1207539 1292
- Four hours?
- Yes, sir.

353 1208916 1041
That would be impressive,

354 1210042 1333
except if you had known
what you were looking for,

355 1211460 1792
you would have seen it
written on my dorm room window.

356 1218967 1042
So?

357 1220093 2335
Six months academic probation.

358 1222638 2126
Wow. Well, they had to make
an example out of you.

359 1224848 1584
They had my blog.

360 1226516 1793
I shouldn't have written
that thing about the farm animals.

361 1228393 1292
That was stupid.

362 1229770 3085
But I was kidding, for God's sakes.
Doesn't anybody have a sense of humor?

363 1232940 2418
- I tried to stop you.
- I know.

364 1235442 3544
How do you do this thing where
you manage to get all girls to hate us?

365 1239071 1917
- And why do I let you?
- I know.

366 1241073 2501
- You can't do that.
- Wardo, I said I know.

367 1243659 2084
Okay, let's look at a sample problem.

368 1245827 3378
Suppose we're given a computer
with a 16-bit virtual address

369 1249289 2293
and a page size of 256 bytes.

370 1252501 4378
The system uses one-level page tables
that start at address hex 400.

371 1257422 3169
Maybe you want DMA on your 16-bit system.
Who knows?

372 1261176 3169
The first few pages are reserved
for hardware flags, etc.

373 1264429 2877
Assume page-table entries have
eight status bits.

374 1267849 2377
The eight status bits would then be...

375 1270310 1292
Anybody?

376 1272854 2460
And I see we have our first surrender.

377 1275399 1292
Don't worry, Mr. Zuckerberg.

378 1276775 2210
Brighter men than you
have tried and failed this class.

379 1279069 4795
One valid bit, one modified bit,
one reference bit and five permission bits.

380 1285867 1334
That is correct.

381 1287953 2209
Does everybody see how he got there?

382 1295877 1126
Mark?

383 1297879 2168
- You Mark Zuckerberg?
- Yeah.

384 1300424 1917
- Cameron Winklevoss.
- Hi.

385 1302426 1041
Tyler Winklevoss.

386 1303552 1375
Are you guys related?

387 1305012 1500
- That's good.
- Funny.

388 1306596 1459
We never heard that before.

389 1308557 1876
So, what can I do for you?
Did I insult your girlfriends?

390 1310517 2084
No. You didn't. Actually, I don't know.

391 1312686 1709
- Yeah, we never asked.
- We should do that.

392 1314479 1042
No.

393 1315605 1960
We have an idea
we want to talk to you about.

394 1318900 1042
You got a minute?

395 1320027 3043
You guys look like
you spend some time at the gym.

396 1323155 1542
- We have to.
- Why?

397 1324781 1417
We row crew.

398 1327576 1542
- Yeah, I've got a minute.
- Great.

399 1334124 2001
- So, you ever been inside the Porcellian?
- No.

400 1336209 1626
You understand we can't take you
past the bike room,

401 1337919 1084
because you're not a member.

402 1339087 1417
I've heard.

403 1343258 3002
- You want a sandwich or something?
- Okay.

404 1346345 1667
- Mark, right?
- Yeah.

405 1348096 2001
- Mark, this is Divya Narendra, our partner.
- Hi.

406 1350182 1834
We were really impressed with Facemash.

407 1352100 2585
When we checked you out,
you also built CourseMatch.

408 1354770 1041
I don't know CourseMatch.

409 1355896 2418
You go online and see
what courses your friends are taking.

410 1358398 1626
It's really smart, man.

411 1362194 1083
- Mark.
- Yeah.

412 1363362 1792
We were talking about CourseMatch.

413 1366823 1376
It was kind of a no-brainer.

414 1368283 1959
But you invented something
in high school, too, right?

415 1370744 3002
An app for an MP3 player
that recognizes your taste in music.

416 1374581 1209
Anybody try to buy it?

417 1376416 1042
Microsoft.

418 1377542 2085
Wow. How much?

419 1379711 2085
Didn't sell it. Uploaded it for free.

420 1381880 1667
- For free?
- Yeah.

421 1383715 1125
Why?

422 1386718 2543
Okay, well, we have something
that we've been working on for a while

423 1389346 1083
and we think it's great.

424 1390514 1250
It's called the Harvard Connection.

425 1391848 3419
You create your own page.
Interests, bio, friends, pics.

426 1395352 2293
And then people can go online,
see your bio, request to be your...

427 1397729 2418
Yeah, how is that different
from MySpace or Friendster?

428 1403443 1709
Harvard. Edu.

429 1405278 2377
Harvard. Edu is the most prestigious
e-mail address in the country, man.

430 1407781 2293
I mean, the whole site's kind of
based on the idea that girls...

431 1410158 1918
Not to put anything indelicately, but...

432 1412160 1751
Girls wanna go with guys
who go to Harvard.

433 1413995 2293
Divya and my brother don't have trouble
putting things indelicately.

434 1416373 3502
The main difference between what we're
talking about and MySpace or Friendster,

435 1420001 1376
or any of those other
social networking sites is...

436 1421503 2710
Is exclusivity. Right?

437 1425048 1042
- Right.
- Yeah.

438 1426174 1459
We'd love for you to work with us, Mark.

439 1427717 1710
I mean, we need a gifted programmer
who's creative.

440 1429511 1626
And we know that
you've been taking it in the shins.

441 1431221 2919
Women's groups are ready
to declare a fatwa.

442 1434224 2460
But, you know, this could help
rehabilitate your image.

443 1437394 2293
Wow. You would do that for me?

444 1442357 1000
We'd like to work with you.

445 1443483 3044
Our first programmer graduated
and went to work for Google.

446 1446653 2543
Our second programmer
just got overwhelmed with schoolwork.

447 1449322 3169
We would need you to build the site and
write the code, and we'll provide all the...

448 1452576 1292
I'm in.

449 1455370 1167
What?

450 1457539 1000
I'm in.

451 1458999 958
Awesome.

452 1460542 1167
That's what you said?

453 1462544 2543
It was three or four years ago.
I don't know what I said.

454 1465213 1292
When did you come to Eduardo?

455 1466923 1668
I don't understand that question.

456 1468717 1625
Do you remember answering
in the affirmative?

457 1471052 1126
The affirmative?

458 1472262 1959
When did you come to Eduardo
with the idea for Facebook?

459 1474556 1375
It was called The Facebook then.

460 1477058 1501
This doesn't need to be that difficult.

461 1479060 2085
I'm currently in the middle
of two different lawsuits.

462 1481229 1376
Did you answer affirmatively

463 1482731 2418
when Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss
and Divya Narendra

464 1485233 1584
asked you to build Harvard Connection?

465 1486902 1667
Did you say yes?

466 1490238 1209
I said I'd help.

467 1491573 2960
When did you approach Mr. Saverin
with the idea for The Facebook?

468 1494618 1500
I wouldn't say I approached him.

469 1496244 2126
- Sy.
- You can answer the question.

470 1498455 2418
At a party at Alpha Epsilon Pi.

471 1500957 1376
What's that?

472 1502417 1959
The Jewish fraternity.

473 1505754 1459
It was Caribbean Night.

474 1524439 2710
It's not that guys like me
are generally attracted to Asian girls.

475 1527275 2877
It's that Asian girls are
generally attracted to guys like me.

476 1530278 2001
I'm developing an algorithm
to define the connection

477 1532405 1876
between Jewish guys and Asian girls.

478 1534407 2961
I don't think it's that complicated.
They're hot, they're smart,

479 1537452 2960
they're not Jewish, and they can't dance.

480 1540580 1376
Hey, Mark's here.

481 1542082 1167
Mark!

482 1546419 1543
Be right back.

483 1555512 1042
I think I've come up with something.

484 1556638 2209
Hang on. I gotta tell you something
that you're not gonna believe.

485 1558974 1000
What?

486 1560100 2251
I got punched by the Phoenix.

487 1563645 1000
- Are you kidding?
- No.

488 1564771 2293
I mean, it's just the first
of a four-step process,

489 1567148 2794
but they slid the invitation
under my door tonight.

490 1570026 1876
I go to my first punch party tomorrow.

491 1571987 1166
So...

492 1573655 2001
You got punched by the Phoenix.

493 1575782 2668
Yeah, but, you know,
it was probably just a diversity thing.

494 1578994 2042
It was just a diversity thing.
Just ride that horse until...

495 1581162 1668
What did you wanna talk to me about?

496 1582956 1417
- Mark?
- Yeah.

497 1584499 1000
You said you'd come up with something.

498 1585625 2585
Yeah, I think I've come up with something.
Come outside and let's talk.

499 1588336 1251
It's 20 degrees outside.

500 1589671 2168
I can't stare at that loop of Niagara Falls,

501 1591965 2043
which has absolutely
nothing to do with the Caribbean.

502 1605812 1334
People came to Facemash
in a stampede, right?

503 1607230 1084
Yeah.

504 1608398 1584
But it wasn't because
they saw pictures of hot girls.

505 1610066 2210
You can go anywhere on the Internet
and see pictures of hot girls.

506 1612360 1042
Yeah.

507 1613528 2627
It was because they saw pictures
of girls that they knew.

508 1616656 1918
People want to go on the Internet
and check out their friends,

509 1618700 1417
so why not build a website that offers that?

510 1620201 3128
Friends, pictures, profiles,
whatever you can visit.

511 1623413 1792
Browse around.
Maybe it's someone you just met at a party.

512 1625332 2084
But I'm not talking about a dating site.

513 1627542 5379
I'm talking about taking the entire social
experience of college and putting it online.

514 1633340 2251
- I can't feel my legs.
- I know.

515 1635717 1500
I'm totally psyched about this, too.
But, Wardo?

516 1637344 1041
Yeah?

517 1638553 2001
"It would be exclusive."

518 1641056 2585
You would have to know the people
on the site to get past your own page.

519 1643725 1876
Like getting punched.

520 1646561 1042
Now, that's good.

521 1647729 2126
Wardo, it's like a final club,
except we're the president.

522 1650398 2710
I told him I thought it sounded great.

523 1653860 1375
It was a great idea.

524 1655362 1000
There was nothing to hack.

525 1656446 3044
People were gonna provide
their own pictures, their own information.

526 1659574 4796
And people had the ability to invite,
or not invite, their friends to join.

527 1665038 3461
See, in a world where
social structure was everything,

528 1669125 1292
that was the thing.

529 1670960 1334
It was a big project,

530 1672420 3127
and he was going to have to write
tens of thousands of lines of code,

531 1675632 2626
so I wondered why he was
coming to me and not his roommates,

532 1678343 2668
Dustin Moskovitz and Chris Hughes.
They were programmers.

533 1681137 3336
We're gonna need a little start-up cash
to rent the servers and get it online.

534 1685642 1042
So that was why.

535 1686768 1626
- Did he offer terms?
- Yes.

536 1688478 1959
We'll split it, 70/30.

537 1690605 2460
70 for me, 30 for you
for putting up the $1,000

538 1693149 2252
and for handling everything
on the business end. You're CFO.

539 1695485 1042
And you said?

540 1696611 1626
I said, "Let's do it."

541 1698321 1876
Okay. Did he add anything else?

542 1700615 1042
Yes.

543 1705370 2585
It probably was a diversity thing.

544 1709165 1167
But so what?

545 1710500 1292
Why do you think he said that?

546 1711876 2210
Gretchen, excuse me for interrupting,
but whose discovery is this?

547 1714170 1751
Sy, if you'll let me continue
with my line of questioning.

548 1716005 1084
What are you suggesting?

549 1717173 2168
That I was jealous of Eduardo
for getting punched by the Phoenix

550 1719467 1542
and began a plan
to screw him out of a company

551 1721136 1667
- I hadn't even invented yet.
- Were you?

552 1722887 1251
- Gretchen.
- Jealous of Eduardo?

553 1724222 1250
Stop typing. We're off the record.

554 1725557 1041
Ma'am, I know you've done your homework,

555 1726683 1584
and so you know that money
isn't a big part of my life.

556 1728351 2001
But at the moment,
I could buy Mount Auburn Street,

557 1730478 3169
take the Phoenix Club
and turn it into my ping-pong room.

558 1737861 2001
I'll let you know how the party is.

559 1745702 3294
We recognize that you're a plaintiff
in one suit involving Facebook,

560 1749164 1333
and a witness in another.

561 1750582 1083
Yes, sir.

562 1751750 3002
At any time in the weeks
prior to Mark's telling you his idea,

563 1754836 2501
did he mention Tyler Winklevoss,
Cameron Winklevoss,

564 1757422 2293
Divya Narendra or Harvard Connection?

565 1759841 2627
Yes. He said they'd asked him
to work on their site,

566 1762552 3920
but that he looked at what they had
and decided it wasn't worth his time.

567 1766556 1584
He said even his most pathetic friends

568 1768224 3878
knew more about getting people
interested in a website than these guys.

569 1772187 1917
"These guys," meaning my clients.

570 1774189 3961
Yes. He resented...
Mark resented that your clients thought

571 1778234 2418
that he needed to rehabilitate
his image after Facemash.

572 1780737 2084
But Mark didn't want
to rehabilitate anything.

573 1782906 2793
With Facemash, he'd hacked into
the Harvard computers,

574 1785784 2626
he'd thumbed his nose at the Ad Board,
he'd gotten a lot of notoriety.

575 1788536 2585
Facemash did exactly
what he wanted it to do.

576 1791206 2459
Were you aware that while Mr. Zuckerberg
was building The Facebook,

577 1793750 1792
he was also communicating
with the plaintiffs?

578 1795627 2168
Not at the time, I wasn't. But...

579 1799714 2794
It really didn't have much to do
with the Winklevosses' dating site.

580 1802592 1042
How would you know?
You weren't even there.

581 1803718 1084
Ty.

582 1805136 3086
Were you aware that while Mr. Zuckerberg
was building The Facebook,

583 1808306 3461
he was leading the plaintiffs to believe
he was building Harvard Connection?

584 1811893 1417
You're offering a conclusion
not found in evidence.

585 1813394 2669
We are about to find it in evidence.

586 1816606 2376
From Mark Zuckerberg to Tyler Winklevoss.

587 1819067 1917
November 30th, 2003.

588 1821069 2793
"I read over all the stuff you sent me
re: Harvard Connection.

589 1823947 2543
"And it seems like it shouldn't
take too long to implement.

590 1826574 4712
"So we can talk about it after I get all
the basic functionality up tomorrow night."

591 1831412 4379
From Mark Zuckerberg
to Cameron Winklevoss. December 1 st, 2003.

592 1835917 3461
"Sorry I was unreachable tonight.
I just got about three of your missed calls.

593 1839462 2835
"I was working on a problem set
for my systems class."

594 1842423 2252
From Mark Zuckerberg
to Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss.

595 1844759 2168
December 10, 2003.

596 1847512 2668
"This week has been pretty busy
thus far with classes and work,

597 1850265 3127
"so I think it's probably best
to postpone the meeting."

598 1853476 2126
"I'm also really busy tomorrow."

599 1855687 3377
Okay, anybody else feel like
there's something up with this guy?

600 1859148 1042
Tell him okay,

601 1860275 2751
but we do have to make sure that
we meet up before we all go off for break.

602 1863611 2752
I know, I know. Yeah, watch out.

603 1897312 1208
Hey, Mark.

604 1898646 2877
I need a dedicated Linux box
running Apache with a MySQL back end.

605 1901649 1459
It's gonna cost a little more money.

606 1903192 2377
- How much more?
- About 200 more.

607 1905737 2418
- Do we need it?
- Gotta handle the traffic.

608 1911492 1876
- Do it.
- I already did.

609 1917707 1125
Hey, guess what?

610 1920543 1626
I made the second cut.

611 1922879 1042
That's good.

612 1924005 3669
You should be proud of that right there.
Don't worry if you don't make it any further.

613 1932513 1459
I'll get out of here.

614 1934057 2334
From Mark Zuckerberg
to Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss

615 1936476 1041
and Divya Narendra.

616 1937602 2168
December 15th, 2003.

617 1939854 2376
"I have a CS problem set
that I'm just getting started with

618 1942315 3669
"and it should be about 15 hours of coding,
so I'll be busy tomorrow night."

619 1946069 3335
"I won't really be free to meet
until next Wednesday afternoon."

620 1949489 2126
"I have to cancel Wednesday afternoon.

621 1951699 3169
"I've basically been in the lab
this whole time, and also I..."

622 1954994 4587
"...won't be able to do Saturday,
as I have to meet up with my parents."

623 1963711 4420
As the plaque reads, this is John Harvard,
founder of Harvard University in 1638.

624 1968216 2334
It's also called the Statue of Three Lies.

625 1971344 2126
What are the three lies?

626 1974347 1083
Mr. Dowd.

627 1975556 2085
The three lies. First...

628 1977809 1041
Shit!

629 1978935 1834
- Take your pants off.
- I know.

630 1981938 1250
Mr. Saverin.

631 1983272 3545
One, Harvard was founded in 1636, not 1638.

632 1986901 2335
Two, Harvard was not founded
by John Harvard.

633 1989320 1542
And three, that is not John Harvard.

634 1990947 1333
Who is it?

635 1992865 3628
It's a friend of the sculptor, Daniel Chester.

636 1997412 1125
Keep yourjacket on.

637 2002500 3461
Thirty-nine days after Mr. Zuckerberg's
initial meeting with my clients,

638 2006045 3378
and he still hadn't completed work
on Harvard Connection.

639 2009549 2751
But on January 11th, 2004,

640 2013052 3211
Mr. Zuckerberg registered
the domain name The Facebook

641 2016347 2794
via Network Solutions.

642 2020309 3962
To the best of your knowledge, had he even
begun work on Harvard Connection?

643 2025440 2042
Not to my knowledge. No.

644 2031779 2126
What in the world is this?

645 2035033 4086
"Hey, Cameron, I'm still a little skeptical
that we have enough functionality in the site

646 2039203 2585
"to really draw the attention
and gain the critical mass necessary

647 2041998 2501
"to get a site like this to run"?

648 2045043 1375
"We'll speak soon"?

649 2048713 2626
This is the first time
he mentioned any problem?

650 2051466 1041
Yes, it was.

651 2052592 4503
You sent 36 e-mails to Mr. Zuckerberg
and received 16 e-mails in return,

652 2057180 2585
and this was the first time
he indicated he was not happy.

653 2059849 1042
That's correct.

654 2060975 2668
He had 42 days to study our system
and get out ahead.

655 2063728 2084
- Do you see any of your code on Facebook?
- Sy, could you...

656 2065897 1542
Did I use any of your code?

657 2067523 1834
You stole our whole goddamn idea.

658 2069442 2209
- Fellas.
- What? Match.com for Harvard guys?

659 2071736 1125
Can I continue with my deposition?

660 2072945 3128
You know, you really don't need
a forensics team to get to the bottom of this.

661 2076157 1626
If you guys were the inventors of Facebook,

662 2079160 2001
you'd have invented Facebook.

663 2081954 2585
I can't wait to stand over your shoulder
and watch you write us a check.

664 2084624 1292
No shit.

665 2087668 1334
Let's continue.

666 2090671 2460
February 4, 2004.

667 2096719 3086
Mark.

668 2099889 3878
There is a girl in your art history class.
Her name is Stephanie Attis.

669 2103851 1876
Do you happen to know
if she has a boyfriend?

670 2107188 2209
Have you ever seen her with anyone?

671 2111567 3127
And, if not, do you happen to know
if she's looking to go out with anyone?

672 2114821 1250
Dustin.

673 2117532 3752
People don't walk around with
a sign on them that says...

674 2125414 1167
Mark?

675 2153192 2251
We were supposed to meet at 9:00.

676 2155528 2752
- Have you slept yet?
- I have to add something.

677 2158364 1167
What?

678 2170710 1959
Shit, that looks good.
That looks really good.

679 2172753 1459
It's clean and simple.

680 2174297 2710
No Disneyland, no "live nude girls."
But watch.

681 2178384 1751
What'd you write?

682 2180386 2794
"Relationship Status." "Interested In."

683 2183306 2877
This is what drives life at college.
"Are you having sex or aren't you?"

684 2186267 3294
It's why people take certain classes
and sit where they sit and do what they do.

685 2189645 3878
And at its center, you know, that's
what The Facebook is gonna be about.

686 2193608 2209
People are gonna log on because
after all the cake and watermelon,

687 2195902 1041
there's a chance they're actually gonna...

688 2197028 2209
- Gonna get laid.
...meet a girl. Yes.

689 2199822 1042
That is really good.

690 2200948 1042
And that was it.

691 2202074 1668
- What do you mean?
- It's ready.

692 2203826 2126
- It's ready? Right now?
- Yeah. That was it.

693 2206537 1501
And here's the masthead.

694 2208122 1459
- You made a masthead.
- Yeah.

695 2209665 3378
- "Eduardo Saverin, co-founder and CFO."
- Yeah.

696 2213127 2043
You have no idea what
that's gonna mean to my father.

697 2215254 1334
Sure I do.

698 2219091 2043
So when's it going live?

699 2221719 2418
Right now. Get your laptop out.

700 2224805 2085
What? Why do we need my laptop?

701 2226974 3503
Because you got e-mails
for everybody at the Phoenix.

702 2234023 4045
Yeah, I'm not sure if it's gonna be cool
with them that I spam their e-mails.

703 2238152 2710
- This is not spam.
- No, I know it's not spam.

704 2240947 2334
If we send it to our friends,
it's just gonna bounce around Dworkin.

705 2243366 1333
I haven't gotten in yet.

706 2244784 3043
These guys know people.
And I need their e-mails.

707 2249664 1208
- Sure.
- Good.

708 2252124 1042
Give me the mailing list.

709 2253251 2334
Jabberwock12.listserv@harvard.edu.

710 2255670 1166
These guys.

711 2256921 1042
Yeah, they're literary geniuses

712 2258047 2126
because the world's most obvious
Lewis Carroll reference is in...

713 2260258 1542
- They're not so bad.
- I'm just saying.

714 2261884 1793
Yeah, you're right.

715 2270559 1543
The site's live.

716 2273020 2210
You know, let's go get a drink and celebrate.

717 2276732 1417
I'm buying.

718 2279568 1167
Mark.

719 2283531 1375
Mark, are you praying?

720 2298337 2543
Whatever happened to Cole Porter
and Irving Berlin?

721 2301048 2001
It's a Valentine's Day theme.
They're playing love songs.

722 2303134 1041
Good point.

723 2304260 2918
'Cause Cole Porter and Irving Berlin
never wrote any love songs.

724 2310933 2418
Honey, you should put your laptop away.

725 2313436 1959
Seven different people
spammed me the same link.

726 2315479 1584
- KC.
- What is it?

727 2317148 1041
I don't know.

728 2318274 1751
But I'm really hoping
it's Cats That Look Like Hitler,

729 2320109 1709
'cause I can never get enough of that.

730 2323988 1500
No, it's not.

731 2329035 1166
Div!

732 2331787 1167
What?

733 2338669 1042
This isn't mine.

734 2340504 1042
Okay, what is wrong?

735 2344550 2418
It's fine. It's fine. It's fine.

736 2361192 3460
Hey!

737 2364737 1167
Not now!

738 2365988 1084
We need 20 minutes!

739 2367156 1375
Okay.

740 2369700 3169
I just wanted to let you know
that Zuckerberg stole our website.

741 2374455 1667
Mark Zuckerberg?

742 2376582 1834
He stole our website.

743 2379251 1626
It's been live for more than 36 hours.

744 2386092 2501
Mr. Hotchkiss?
Ty, lawyer's on the phone with Dad.

745 2388677 2544
Yes, sir, I'm here with my brother Tyler
and our business partner Divya.

746 2391305 1042
"Welcome to The Facebook.

747 2392431 1918
"The Facebook is an online directory
that connects people

748 2394433 1459
"through different social networks.

749 2395976 3169
"You must have a harvard. Edu address
to register."

750 2399230 2459
Yeah, I called earlier.
I'm looking for Mark Zuckerberg.

751 2401774 1334
Yes, sir.
He's actually quoted a couple times.

752 2403192 1042
I can read it to you.

753 2404318 3211
"'Everyone's been talking a lot about a
universal facebook within Harvard,' he says."

754 2407613 1042
"He" meaning Mark.

755 2408739 1959
"'I think it's kind of silly
that it would take the university

756 2410783 1125
"'a couple of years to get around to it.

757 2411992 2544
"'I can do a classierjob than they can
and I did it in a week."'

758 2414620 1209
Tell him Divya Narendra called.

759 2415913 2084
- I know, that's how he talks.
- Appreciate it.

760 2418082 2084
"As of yesterday evening, Zuckerberg said,

761 2420251 3752
"over 650 students had registered
to use thefacebook. Com.

762 2424088 3586
"He said he anticipated that 900 students
would have joined the site by this morning."

763 2427800 3210
Yeah, Divya was just reading that 650
students signed up for it on the first day.

764 2431095 4253
God, if I was a drug dealer I couldn't
give free drugs to 650 people in one day.

765 2435433 3502
And this guy doesn't have three friends
to rub together to make a fourth.

766 2439019 1501
All right.
Yes, that's what we'll do, Mr. Hotchkiss.

767 2440646 1876
We'll put all this together
and we'll e-mail it to you.

768 2442648 1709
Well, you won't be able
to go on the website yourself.

769 2445359 2168
Because you don't have a Harvard...

770 2447695 2251
You know what, it would just be easier
for us to e-mail it to you.

771 2450030 1000
I'm sure you're right.

772 2451157 2876
He's a good guy and he's very bright
and I'm sure he didn't mean to do...

773 2454118 1083
Wow.

774 2455661 1042
...what he did.

775 2457621 1417
All right, thank you very much. And, Dad...

776 2459665 1042
All right, love you, too.

777 2460791 2752
- This is a good guy?
- We don't know that he's not a good guy.

778 2463627 1000
We know he stole our idea.

779 2464712 1417
We know he lied to our faces
for a month and a half.

780 2466213 2168
- No, he never lied to our faces.
- Okay, he never saw our faces.

781 2468466 3419
Fine, he lied to our e-mail accounts
and he gave himself a 42-day head start,

782 2471969 2001
because he knows
what apparently you don't,

783 2474054 1751
which is that getting there first
is everything.

784 2475890 1000
I'm a competitive racer, Div.

785 2477016 3377
I don't think you need to school me in the
importance of getting there first. Thank you.

786 2480728 2084
- That was your father's lawyer?
- It was his in-house counsel.

787 2482897 1917
He's gonna look at all this
and if he thinks it's appropriate

788 2484899 1000
he'll send a cease-and-desist letter.

789 2486025 1041
What's that gonna do?

790 2487151 1334
What, do you wanna hire an IP lawyer
and sue him?

791 2488569 3169
No, I wanna hire the Sopranos to beat
the shit out of him with a hammer.

792 2491822 1084
- We don't even have to do that.
- That's right.

793 2493032 3294
We could do that ourselves.
I'm 6'5", 220, and there's two of me.

794 2496410 1000
- I'm with this guy.
- Well, whatever.

795 2497536 2377
I'm saying, let's calm down
until we know what we're talking about.

796 2499997 2084
How much more information
are you waiting for?

797 2502166 2835
We met with Mark three times,
we exchanged 52 e-mails,

798 2505085 1584
we can prove that he looked at the code.

799 2506754 3085
- What is that on the bottom of the page?
- It says "A Mark Zuckerberg production."

800 2509924 2251
- On the home page?
- On every page.

801 2512259 2669
Shit, I need a second to let
the classiness waft over me.

802 2515054 1041
Okay, look, we don't know...

803 2516222 1875
Cam, they wrote, "Zuckerberg said
he hoped the privacy options

804 2518224 1875
"would help restore his reputation

805 2520226 2960
"following student outrage
over facemash. Com."

806 2523270 3336
That's exactly what we said to him.
He's giving us the finger in The Crimson.

807 2527274 2085
While we're waiting for Dad's lawyer
to look this stuff over,

808 2529443 2418
we can at least get something
going in the paper so people know...

809 2531946 1500
- What?
...that this is in dispute.

810 2533572 2043
We're not starting a knife fight
in The Crimson.

811 2535699 1417
And we're not suing anybody.

812 2537243 1292
Why not?

813 2539954 2501
I don't understand, I don't understand.
Why not?

814 2543624 1834
He's gonna say it's stupid.

815 2545543 1000
What, who, me?

816 2546627 1500
Say it. Why not?

817 2549547 2167
Because we're gentlemen of Harvard.

818 2551799 4336
This is Harvard, where you don't
plant stories and you don't sue people.

819 2556804 2918
You thought he was gonna be
the only one who thought that was stupid?

820 2559807 2668
During the time when you say
you had this idea,

821 2563143 3503
did you know Tyler and Cameron
came from a family of means?

822 2567398 1417
"A family of means"?

823 2568899 1542
Did you know their father was wealthy?

824 2571735 1251
I'm not sure why you're asking me that.

825 2573070 2251
It's not important you be sure
why I'm asking.

826 2575447 1960
- It's not important to you.
- Sy.

827 2578492 1834
Did you know that they came from money?

828 2580452 1876
I had no idea whether
they came from money or not.

829 2582454 1960
In one of your e-mails to Mr. Narendra,

830 2584498 3336
you referenced Howard Winklevoss'
consulting firm.

831 2587960 1208
If you say so.

832 2589295 3711
Howard Winklevoss founded a firm whose
assets are in the hundreds of millions.

833 2593132 2209
You also knew Tyler and Cameron
were members

834 2595426 2334
of a Harvard final club called the Porcellian.

835 2597845 1250
They pointed that out.

836 2599179 2001
- Excuse us for inviting you in.
- To the bike room.

837 2601307 3961
Please. So it's safe to say you were aware
that my clients had money.

838 2606937 1000
Yes.

839 2608022 1417
Let me tell you why I'm asking.

840 2609523 3419
I'm wondering why, if you needed $1,000
for an Internet venture,

841 2613027 1584
you didn't ask my clients for it.

842 2614695 2501
They had demonstrated an interest to you
in that kind of thing.

843 2617323 3043
I went to my friend for the money because
that's who I wanted to be partners with.

844 2620492 2460
Eduardo was the president of
the Harvard Investors Association,

845 2623037 1959
and he was also my best friend.

846 2625831 3628
Your best friend is suing you
for $600 million.

847 2630002 2376
I didn't know that. Tell me more.

848 2632504 2210
Eduardo, what happened
after the initial launch?

849 2634840 2210
I'm sorry, Sy, would you mind
addressing him as Mr. Saverin?

850 2637176 1625
- Gretchen, they're best friends.
- Not anymore.

851 2638886 2001
Well, we already went through this on the...
Never mind.

852 2641013 2627
Mr. Saverin, what happened
after the initial launch?

853 2643724 1417
It exploded.

854 2645225 1835
Everybody on campus was using it.

855 2647144 3586
"Facebook me" was a common expression
after two weeks.

856 2651190 1041
And Mark?

857 2652316 3836
And Mark was the biggest thing on
a campus that included 19 Nobel laureates,

858 2656236 4504
15 Pulitzer Prize winners,
two future Olympians, and a movie star.

859 2660908 1584
Who was the movie star?

860 2662576 1584
Does it matter?

861 2664536 1042
No.

862 2667873 3753
...at Out of Town News and picked up
that copy of PopularElectronics magazine

863 2671752 2168
with the MITS Altair kit on the cover.

864 2674046 2501
It was a beautiful day
and I was in my Radcliffe dorm room.

865 2676632 2043
He brought that magazine up
and he showed it to me and he said,

866 2678759 3878
"Look, it's gonna happen without us.
We've gotta start now."

867 2682763 3127
And I said, "Okay.
Let's get BASIC out there."

868 2686475 2877
Now, most of you think you know
the rest of the story, but you may not.

869 2689436 2293
The beginnings of this industry
were very humble.

870 2691814 4253
That kit computer on the cover of
that magazine had an 8080 processor in it.

871 2696151 4128
Unless you paid extra for
a 1 K memory board, you got 256 bytes.

872 2700823 3961
So the challenge when I wrote BASIC
wasn't just to run at 4 k-bytes,

873 2704910 4879
but I also had to leave room for the users
to run their programs in 4 k-bytes.

874 2710958 2001
Your friend. Is that Mark Zuckerberg?

875 2713293 1042
Yeah.

876 2714461 2168
- He made The Facebook.
- Yeah.

877 2716964 2334
I mean, it's both of ours. We're...

878 2719425 1834
Yeah, we... Yes.

879 2721343 1167
Cool.

880 2722803 1459
I'm Christy Ling. This is Alice.

881 2724346 1042
Hi.

882 2725472 2210
Well, very nice to meet you.

883 2728016 1501
Facebook me when you get home.

884 2729643 1501
You know, maybe we can all go out
and grab a drink.

885 2731979 1000
Certainly.

886 2733147 1834
Absolutely do that.

887 2741780 3169
She said, "Facebook me
and we can all go for a drink later,"

888 2745033 1543
which is stunningly great for two reasons.

889 2746660 2710
One, she said "facebook me," right?
And then the other is, well, you know...

890 2749496 1000
They wanna have drinks later.

891 2750622 1584
Yes, have you ever heard
so many different good things

892 2752332 1501
packed into one regular-sized sentence?

893 2753959 1667
Excuse me, Mark?

894 2756170 1083
Yeah?

895 2757337 1835
I'm Stuart Singer. I'm in your OS lab.

896 2759840 1042
Sure.

897 2761383 1834
- Awesome job with The Facebook.
- Awesome job.

898 2763343 1000
Thanks.

899 2764470 1792
- I'm Bob.
- How you doing?

900 2766346 1418
You know, I could swear
he was looking at you

901 2767848 3210
when he said the next Bill Gates
could be right in this room.

902 2771185 1458
I doubt it.

903 2772728 2543
And I showed up late.
I don't even know who the speaker was.

904 2776690 1501
It was Bill Gates.

905 2779443 2001
Shit, that makes sense.

906 2782279 2084
All right. Thanks, guys.

907 2786867 1709
- Are you a moron?
- Are you medically stupid?

908 2788702 1667
You can't tell Bill Gates
is in front of you for an hour?

909 2790454 1834
I wasn't wearing my contacts.

910 2792372 2377
Can I get a Glock and kill you?

911 2796376 1584
It's time to monetize the thing.

912 2798045 1292
What were their names?

913 2799421 1793
- Hear what I just said?
- When?

914 2801298 2084
I said it's time to monetize the site.

915 2804384 1000
What does that mean?

916 2805469 2835
It means it's time for the website
to start generating revenue.

917 2808388 2335
No, I know what the word means.
I'm asking how you wanna do it.

918 2812059 1667
- Advertising.
- No.

919 2814144 2126
Well, we got 4,000 members.

920 2816396 1126
'Cause The Facebook is cool,

921 2817606 3211
and if we start installing pop-ups
for Mountain Dew, it's not gonna be cool.

922 2820901 1626
Well, I wasn't thinking Mountain Dew,
but at some point,

923 2822611 2460
and I'm talking as the business end
of the company, the site...

924 2825155 3211
We don't even know what it is yet.
We don't know what it is.

925 2828450 2460
We don't know what it can be.
We don't know what it will be.

926 2830994 1334
We know that it is cool.

927 2832412 2210
That is a priceless asset I'm not giving up.

928 2834748 2168
- So when will it be finished?
- It won't be finished.

929 2837000 1709
That's the point.
The way fashion's never finished.

930 2838794 2293
- What?
- Fashion. Fashion is never finished.

931 2841171 1459
You're talking about fashion? Really, you?

932 2842756 2543
I'm talking about the idea of it
and I'm saying that it's never finished.

933 2845425 3336
Okay. But they manage
to make money selling pants.

934 2850013 1501
Mark, what is this?

935 2851598 1459
- What?
- This.

936 2853141 2293
It's called a cease-and-desist letter.
What were their names?

937 2855519 1042
- Who?
- The girls.

938 2856645 1167
When did you get this?

939 2857938 2084
About 10 days ago.
Right after we launched the site.

940 2860107 1834
- Jesus Christ.
- Hey, the girls. What were their names?

941 2862025 3127
The Winklevoss twins are saying
that you stole their idea.

942 2865279 2334
I find that to be a little more
than mildly annoying.

943 2867698 3252
Oh, well, they find it to be
intellectual property theft.

944 2871034 1209
- Look...
- Why didn't you show this to me?

945 2872327 1501
It was addressed to me.

946 2873954 3085
They're saying that we stole The Facebook
from Divya Narendra and the Winklevosses.

947 2877124 2042
- I know what it says.
- Did we?

948 2879293 1000
Did we what?

949 2880377 1584
Don't screw around with me now.
Look at me.

950 2882629 1668
The letter says we could face legal action.

951 2884381 1667
No, it says I could face legal action.

952 2886133 2251
This is from a lawyer, Mark.
They must feel they have some grounds.

953 2888468 3128
- The lawyer is their father's house counsel.
- Do they have grounds?

954 2891680 1417
The grounds are
our thing is cool and popular,

955 2893181 1418
and Harvard Connection is lame.

956 2894683 2251
Wardo, I didn't use any of their code,
I promise.

957 2897019 1041
I didn't use anything.

958 2898145 1834
Look, a guy who builds a nice chair
doesn't owe money

959 2900063 1626
to everyone who ever
has built a chair, okay?

960 2901815 1793
They came to me with an idea,
I had a better one.

961 2903692 2710
- Why didn't you show me this letter?
- I didn't think it was a big deal.

962 2908739 1167
Okay.

963 2911199 5630
So if there's something wrong, if there's
ever anything wrong, you can tell me.

964 2917080 2460
I'm the guy that wants to help.
This is our thing.

965 2919625 3460
Now, is there anything
that you need to tell me?

966 2923545 1084
No.

967 2927925 1542
What are we doing about this?

968 2929551 3419
I went to a 3L at Student Legal Services
and he told me to write them back.

969 2933055 1166
And what did you say?

970 2934306 3127
"When we met in January,
I expressed my doubts about the site.

971 2937517 2377
"Where it stood with graphics,
how much programing was left

972 2939978 1417
"that I had not anticipated."

973 2941480 2251
"The lack of hardware
we had to deal with site use,

974 2943815 3253
"the lack of promotion that would go on
to successfully launch the website."

975 2947152 3586
This was the first time you raised
any of those concerns, right?

976 2950822 1626
I'd raised concerns before.

977 2952532 1251
- Bullshit.
- Not to us.

978 2953867 4045
Gentlemen, I'm talking about at the meeting
in January to which this letter is referring.

979 2957996 1042
Yeah.

980 2959122 1876
Let me rephrase this.

981 2961291 4462
You sent my client 16 e-mails.
In the first 15 you didn't raise any concerns.

982 2965837 1084
Is that a question?

983 2967005 3544
In the 16th e-mail you raised concerns
about the site's functionality.

984 2970634 2752
- Were you leading them on for six weeks?
- No.

985 2973470 3085
Then why didn't you raise
any of these concerns before?

986 2976640 1876
- It's raining.
- I'm sorry?

987 2978600 1250
It just started raining.

988 2979935 3085
Mr. Zuckerberg,
do I have your full attention?

989 2983855 1084
No.

990 2986024 1376
Do you think I deserve it?

991 2987693 1041
What?

992 2988819 2960
Do you think I deserve your full attention?

993 2992322 2043
I had to swear an oath
before we began this deposition

994 2994449 3127
and I don't wanna perjure myself,
so I have a legal obligation to say no.

995 2997661 3794
Okay. No.
You don't think I deserve your attention?

996 3001540 3043
I think if your clients wanna sit on
my shoulders and call themselves tall,

997 3004668 1125
they have a right to give it a try,

998 3005877 3336
but there's no requirement that I enjoy
sitting here listening to people lie.

999 3010382 2335
You have part of my attention.
You have the minimum amount.

1000 3013552 2460
The rest of my attention is
back at the offices of Facebook,

1001 3016096 2293
where my colleagues and I are doing things
that no one in this room,

1002 3018473 1584
including and especially your clients,

1003 3020142 3335
are intellectually or creatively
capable of doing.

1004 3024354 2919
Did I adequately answer
your condescending question?

1005 3034364 3586
Well, I have 12:45.
Why don't we say that's lunch?

1006 3039745 1500
Back at 2:30.

1007 3042122 2084
So what were their names?

1008 3045792 2210
Their names were Christy and Alice,

1009 3050464 2626
and they wanna have drinks tonight.

1010 3055302 3294
You're not supposed to be in here.
This is a men's room.

1011 3062642 1167
Wow.

1012 3077824 1417
Oh, my God.

1013 3080160 1500
I don't care.

1014 3103642 1208
Hey, man, sorry.

1015 3105936 1917
A couple girls are freshening up in there.

1016 3109022 1250
Sweet.

1017 3114694 1709
We have groupies.

1018 3124913 1292
I'll be right back.

1019 3126289 1793
Mark, where you going? Mark.

1020 3133338 1042
Erica?

1021 3136299 1042
Hi.

1022 3137425 2627
I saw you from over there.
I didn't know you came to this club a lot.

1023 3140137 1709
- First time.
- Mine, too.

1024 3142514 1292
Could I talk to you alone for a second?

1025 3145058 1209
I think I'm good right here.

1026 3146351 4045
I just... I'd love to talk to you alone
if we could just go someplace.

1027 3150480 1250
Right here is fine.

1028 3152482 2043
I don't know if you heard about
this new website I launched.

1029 3154609 1084
No.

1030 3156528 2752
- The Facebook?
- You called me a bitch on the Internet, Mark.

1031 3159364 1834
That's why I wanted to talk to you.

1032 3161283 2001
- On the Internet.
- That's why I came over.

1033 3163368 1626
Comparing women to farm animals.

1034 3165495 1459
I didn't end up doing that.

1035 3167038 1668
It didn't stop you from writing it.

1036 3168790 2585
As if every thought that tumbles
through your head was so clever

1037 3171459 2293
it would be a crime for it not to be shared.

1038 3175338 2544
The Internet's not written in pencil, Mark,
it's written in ink,

1039 3177966 2919
and you published that Erica Albright
was a bitch,

1040 3180969 4378
right before you made some ignorant crack
about my family's name, my bra size,

1041 3185432 1834
and then rated women
based on their hotness.

1042 3188518 1959
- Erica, is there a problem?
- No, there's no problem.

1043 3191646 2043
You write your snide bullshit
from a dark room

1044 3193773 2794
because that's what the angry do nowadays.

1045 3197527 2085
I was nice to you. Don't torture me for it.

1046 3199696 1959
If we could just go somewhere for a minute...

1047 3201740 2209
I don't wanna be rude to my friends.

1048 3204034 2418
Okay.

1049 3208246 2377
Good luck with your video game.

1050 3210707 1918
Hey, that was great.
That was the right thing to do.

1051 3212709 1918
You apologized, right?

1052 3217422 1209
We have to expand.

1053 3218715 1417
Sure. Mark?

1054 3222594 1459
Is he mad about something?

1055 3225138 2168
Okay, we are expanding
to Yale and Columbia.

1056 3227390 1709
Dustin, I want you to share
the coding work with me.

1057 3229184 1792
Chris, you're gonna be in charge
of publicity and outreach,

1058 3231061 2209
and you could start by getting a story
in the BU student newspaper.

1059 3233355 1041
It's The Bridge.

1060 3234481 1250
They hate doing stories about Harvard.

1061 3235815 1918
Somebody at the newspaper
will be a computer science major.

1062 3237817 2419
Tell them that Mark Zuckerberg
will do 10 hours of free programing.

1063 3240320 1709
Why do you want a story
in the BU newspaper?

1064 3242113 1209
Because I do. Now here's the arrangement.

1065 3243406 2001
Eduardo is CFO
and owns 30% of the company.

1066 3245492 1542
Dustin is vice president
and head of programing,

1067 3247118 2585
and his 5% of the company
will come from my end.

1068 3249788 1292
Chris is director of publicity,

1069 3251164 2376
and his compensation will depend on
how much work he ends up doing.

1070 3253625 1042
Any questions?

1071 3254751 3586
- Who are the girls?
- Sorry. They're Christy and Alice.

1072 3258546 1167
- Hi.
- Hi.

1073 3259798 1417
- Hello.
- Hi.

1074 3261716 1417
Is there anything we can do?

1075 3263218 1083
No, that's it.

1076 3264386 2334
- Yale and Columbia, let's go.
- And Stanford.

1077 3267430 2001
- What?
- Stanford.

1078 3269516 2209
It's time for them to see this in Palo Alto.

1079 3277607 1334
You don't want any lunch?

1080 3279025 1084
No.

1081 3280527 1667
You're welcome to some salad.

1082 3282279 1542
No, thank you.

1083 3290120 1041
This must be hard.

1084 3292706 1041
Who are you?

1085 3294291 2543
I'm Marylin Delpy.
I introduced myself when we first...

1086 3296918 1376
I mean, what do you do?

1087 3298378 2126
I'm a second-year associate at the firm.

1088 3300588 2585
My boss wanted me to sit in
on the deposition phase.

1089 3304801 1167
What are you doing?

1090 3306052 3002
Checking in to see how it's going in Bosnia.

1091 3309139 1250
Bosnia.

1092 3310598 3086
They don't have roads,
but they have Facebook.

1093 3318606 2752
You must really hate the Winklevosses.

1094 3322193 1251
I don't hate anybody.

1095 3324696 3252
The Winklevi aren't suing me
for intellectual property theft.

1096 3328033 2543
They are suing me because
for the first time in their lives,

1097 3330660 2418
things didn't work out the way
they were supposed to for them.

1098 3340545 1667
He's expanding.

1099 3342380 1084
What?

1100 3343548 1417
He's expanding
to Yale, Columbia and Stanford.

1101 3345175 1041
It's gonna be in The Crimson tomorrow.

1102 3346301 1042
- Really?
- Yep.

1103 3347469 3210
Well, looks like that cease-and-desist letter
really scared the shit out of him, huh?

1104 3350764 3294
I wanna hire a lawyer to file for injunctive
relief and get the site taken down now.

1105 3354142 2960
Every minute the site is up,
Harvard Connection becomes less valuable.

1106 3357187 2793
I want an injunction. I want damages.
I want punitive relief.

1107 3360065 1041
And I want him dead.

1108 3361191 1083
Yeah, I want those things, too.

1109 3362359 1291
Then why aren't we doing anything about it?

1110 3363735 1292
Because we're gentlemen of Harvard?

1111 3365111 1709
No, it's because you're not thinking
how it's gonna look.

1112 3366905 1041
How's it gonna look?

1113 3368031 1208
Like my brother and I
are in skeleton costumes

1114 3369324 2251
chasing the Karate Kid
around a high school gym.

1115 3371701 3586
Cam, he's violated Massachusetts state law.

1116 3375372 1834
When he goes to Connecticut,
New York and California,

1117 3377290 1334
he'll have violated federal law.

1118 3378708 1793
And, by the way,
he's in violation of Harvard law.

1119 3380585 1918
There's no such thing as Harvard law.

1120 3382587 2502
Wait. Yeah, there is.

1121 3390136 1376
Harvard Student Handbook.

1122 3391596 2794
Every freshman is issued one of these,
and somewhere in this book it says...

1123 3394474 1417
You can't steal from another student.

1124 3397852 1751
This is what we needed.
We're going to Summers.

1125 3399687 1876
Well, you can't get a meeting
with Larry Summers.

1126 3401940 1542
My brother and I,
we pay tuition at this school.

1127 3403566 3211
We carry a 3.9 GPA at this school.
We've won trophies for this school.

1128 3406861 2460
And we'll be rowing in the Olympics
for this school.

1129 3409406 3460
I want a meeting with
the goddamn president of this school.

1130 3412951 1500
Why Stanford?

1131 3414577 1751
Why do you think?

1132 3420583 1376
I'm sorry.

1133 3422168 1459
I'm late for biochem.

1134 3425296 1042
Okay.

1135 3429134 1292
You don't know my name, do you?

1136 3431136 1125
Is it Stanford?

1137 3432846 2084
I should just kick your ass.

1138 3435014 2168
How do you go to a party
and you meet someone...

1139 3437308 3211
Amelia Ritter, but you prefer Amy.
You're from Orinda.

1140 3440603 3169
Your father's in commercial real estate
and your mother's 10 years sober.

1141 3444190 1251
What's my major?

1142 3445942 1584
- Trombone.
- Really?

1143 3448153 1875
I remember something about a trombone.

1144 3453825 1292
French.

1145 3455201 1084
Your major's French.

1146 3456369 1667
- And yours?
- Mine?

1147 3458163 2167
- I don't have one.
- You haven't declared?

1148 3461541 1250
I don't go to school.

1149 3462876 1834
- You're kidding.
- No.

1150 3465044 2001
Well, where did you go to school?

1151 3467130 2335
William Taft Elementary, for a little while.

1152 3469549 1083
Seriously?

1153 3471301 2334
You're not like 15 years old or anything,
are you?

1154 3474220 1167
No.

1155 3476055 1084
Wait, you're not like 15, are you?

1156 3477223 1125
No.

1157 3480018 1542
So, what do you do?

1158 3482729 1584
I'm an entrepreneur.

1159 3484397 2502
- You're unemployed.
- I wouldn't say that.

1160 3486983 1083
What would you say?

1161 3488193 1125
That I'm an entrepreneur.

1162 3489402 1667
Well, then, what was your latest preneur?

1163 3491196 4628
Well, I founded an Internet company that
let folks download and share music for free.

1164 3495909 1333
Kind of like Napster?

1165 3497327 1417
Exactly like Napster.

1166 3498870 1626
What do you mean?

1167 3500580 1334
I founded Napster.

1168 3501998 2001
Sean Parker founded Napster.

1169 3504083 1334
Nice to meet you.

1170 3505502 1834
You're Sean Parker?

1171 3507504 1750
You see, the shoe's on the other...

1172 3509380 2043
- Foot?
- Table, which has turned.

1173 3512717 1542
I just slept with Sean Parker?

1174 3514344 1709
You just slept on Sean Parker.

1175 3516429 2251
- You're a zillionaire.
- Not technically.

1176 3518765 1500
What are you?

1177 3520934 1667
Broke. There's not
a lot of money in free music,

1178 3522685 3336
even less when you're being sued by
everyone who's ever been to the Grammys.

1179 3526105 1501
This is blowing my mind.

1180 3527690 1000
I appreciate that.

1181 3528775 1834
I gotta hop in the shower
and get ready for class.

1182 3530735 3377
Biochem, even though you're
a French major whose name is Amy.

1183 3534614 1250
You passed.

1184 3536241 1041
I'm a hard worker.

1185 3538868 3753
There's juice or anything else you can find.
Help yourself.

1186 3542747 1042
You mind if I check my e-mail?

1187 3544374 1584
Yeah, go ahead.

1188 3555969 1166
Amy!

1189 3559305 1167
Jesus.

1190 3560598 2293
- Amy! Can you come out here?
- Yeah?

1191 3563768 1501
Just a second.

1192 3568273 1458
There's a snake in here, Amy.

1193 3569816 1083
What?

1194 3573319 1084
Where?

1195 3574487 1417
There isn't a snake,
but I need to ask you something.

1196 3575989 2001
Are you kidding me? I could've been killed.

1197 3578116 1125
How?

1198 3579325 3753
By running too fast
and getting twisted in the curtain.

1199 3583288 1542
What do you need to ask me?

1200 3584956 2793
Yeah, I went to check my e-mail and
there's a website open on your computer.

1201 3588626 3461
Yeah, after you passed out last night
I went on The Facebook for a little bit.

1202 3592171 2168
- What's that?
- The Facebook?

1203 3594465 2961
Stanford's had it for, like, two weeks now.

1204 3597635 3127
It's really awesome,
except it's freakishly addictive.

1205 3600847 2334
Seriously, I'm on the thing
like five times a day.

1206 3603266 1500
Mind if I send myself an e-mail?

1207 3604851 1500
Yeah, is everything okay?

1208 3606477 1793
Everything's great.

1209 3609022 4253
I just need to find you, Mark Zuckerberg.

1210 3617196 1584
I've never been in this building before.

1211 3618865 4336
This building's 100 years older
than the country it's in, so do be careful.

1212 3624537 1667
We're sitting in chairs.

1213 3627040 1125
Yes.

1214 3629042 2334
Very good. You can go in now.

1215 3635840 2794
That's their own stupidity.
I should've been there.

1216 3638718 1584
Well, darkness is the absence of light,

1217 3640386 2835
and the stupidity in that instance
was the absence of me.

1218 3643348 1875
Catherine, I've got students
in my office now.

1219 3645350 1875
Students. Undergrads.

1220 3647810 1000
I don't know.

1221 3648895 2752
From the looks of it, they want
to sell me a Brooks Brothers franchise.

1222 3651731 1250
All right, bye-bye.

1223 3653858 1042
- Good morning.
- Good morning, sir.

1224 3654984 1918
I'm Cameron Winklevoss
and this is my brother, Tyler.

1225 3656986 2085
And you're here because...

1226 3660531 1042
Either of you can answer.

1227 3661658 1500
I'm sorry, sir,
I thought you were reading the letter.

1228 3663242 1084
I've read the letter.

1229 3664410 3253
Well, we came up with an idea for
a website called Harvard Connection...

1230 3667747 3169
We've since changed the name to ConnectU.
And Mark Zuckerberg stole that idea...

1231 3671042 1375
I understand.

1232 3672543 2460
And I'm asking what you want me
to do about it.

1233 3675088 3919
Well, sir, in the Harvard Student Handbook,
which is distributed to each freshman,

1234 3679092 2334
under the heading "Standards of Conduct
in the Harvard Community,"

1235 3681886 3294
it says the college expects all students
to be honest and forthcoming

1236 3685264 2419
in their dealings with members
in this community.

1237 3687767 2501
Students are required to respect
public and private ownership,

1238 3690895 1876
and instances of theft, misappropriation or...

1239 3692897 1459
- Anne?
- Yes, sir?

1240 3694440 1834
Punch me in the face. Go ahead.

1241 3699237 3961
...or unauthorized use
will result in disciplinary action,

1242 3703282 2001
including the requirement
to withdraw from the college.

1243 3705368 2084
And you memorized that
instead of doing what?

1244 3707578 3378
What my brother and I came here today
to ask of you, respectfully, of course...

1245 3711082 3127
Sir, it's against university rules to steal
from another student, plain and simple.

1246 3714293 1251
And you've spoken to your House Master?

1247 3715628 2335
Yes, sir. And the House Master made
a recommendation to the Ad Board,

1248 3718089 1542
but the Ad Board won't see us.

1249 3719757 1793
Have you tried dealing with
the other student directly?

1250 3721634 2835
Mr. Zuckerberg hasn't been responding
to any of our e-mails or phone calls

1251 3724595 1042
for the last two weeks.

1252 3725763 1793
He doesn't answer when
we knock on his door at Kirkland,

1253 3727640 1834
and the closest I've come
to dealing with him face-to-face

1254 3729600 2293
is when I saw him on the quad
and chased him through Harvard Square.

1255 3731978 1083
You chased him?

1256 3733146 2585
I saw him and I know he saw me.
I went after him and then he disappeared.

1257 3736607 3294
- I don't see this as a university issue.
- Of course this is a university issue.

1258 3739986 2418
There's a code of ethics and an honor code
and he violated them both.

1259 3742488 3461
You enter into a code of ethics with
the university, not with each other.

1260 3746784 3211
I'm sorry, President Summers, but what
you just said makes no sense to me at all.

1261 3750079 1167
I'm devastated by that.

1262 3751330 2669
What my brother means is, if
Mark Zuckerberg walked into our dorm room

1263 3754083 2168
and stole our computer,
that would be a university issue.

1264 3756335 2335
I really don't know.
This office doesn't handle petty larceny.

1265 3758755 1333
This isn't petty larceny.

1266 3760173 2167
This idea is potentially worth
millions of dollars.

1267 3762467 1125
- Millions?
- Yes.

1268 3763676 2585
You might just be letting
your imaginations run away with you.

1269 3766345 2836
Sir, I honestly don't think you're
in any position to make that call.

1270 3769265 4253
I was the US Treasury Secretary.
I'm in some position to make that call.

1271 3773644 1292
Letting our imaginations run away with us

1272 3775021 1917
is exactly what we were told to do
in your freshman address.

1273 3777023 3002
Well, then I would suggest
that you let your imaginations

1274 3780109 1334
run away with you on a new project.

1275 3781527 1167
You would?

1276 3782779 1417
Yes. Everyone at Harvard's
inventing something.

1277 3784322 4628
Harvard undergraduates believe that
inventing a job is better than finding a job.

1278 3789327 3461
So I'll suggest again that the two of you
come up with a new new project.

1279 3792872 3085
- I'm sorry, sir, but that's not the point.
- Please, arrive at the point.

1280 3796042 1751
You don't have to be
an intellectual property expert

1281 3797877 1500
to understand the difference
between right and wrong.

1282 3799504 1792
And you're saying that I don't?

1283 3801380 2001
- Of course I'm not saying that, sir.
- I'm saying that.

1284 3803466 1709
- Really?
- Sir.

1285 3805384 1918
Anne, how did they get this appointment?

1286 3807386 1918
Colleagues of their father.

1287 3810848 2293
Let me tell you something,
Mr. Winklevoss, Mr. Winklevoss,

1288 3813226 2418
since you're on the subject
of right and wrong.

1289 3815728 4253
This action, this meeting,
the two of you being here is wrong.

1290 3820233 3335
It's not worthy of Harvard.
It's not what Harvard saw in you.

1291 3823653 2418
You don't get special treatment.

1292 3826239 2418
- We never asked...
- Just start another project?

1293 3828741 1834
Like we're making a diorama
for a science fair?

1294 3830701 1459
If you have a problem
with that, Mr. Winklevoss...

1295 3832245 1083
We never asked for special treatment.

1296 3833412 3670
...the courts are always at your disposal.
Is there anything else I can do for you?

1297 3837208 1626
You can take the Harvard
Student Handbook and shove it...

1298 3838918 1083
Ty.

1299 3840670 2209
Thank you very much for your time, sir.

1300 3848094 1292
Whoops.

1301 3849595 2502
Broke your 335-year-old doorknob.

1302 3853724 3128
Eduardo, spring break, you
and Mr. Zuckerberg took a trip to New York.

1303 3856936 2585
- Yes.
- What was the purpose of the trip?

1304 3859605 3670
Well, as CFO, I had set up some meetings
with potential advertisers.

1305 3864068 1042
Who paid for the trip?

1306 3865194 3086
It was paid for out of the $1,000 account
I had set up a few months earlier.

1307 3868406 3794
At this point, your $1,000 was the only
money that had been put into the company?

1308 3872285 2001
- Yes.
- How did you feel the meetings went?

1309 3875788 2085
- They went terribly.
- Why?

1310 3878082 1125
Mark was asleep.

1311 3879292 1417
I was not asleep.

1312 3880793 1334
Can I rephrase my answer?

1313 3882295 2001
I wish he'd been asleep.

1314 3887091 3503
So we're in 29 schools now,
with over 75,000 members.

1315 3891429 1125
People who go on The Facebook

1316 3892638 2418
tend to stay on longer
than almost any other website.

1317 3895141 1751
Now, here's the most impressive statistic.

1318 3896976 3002
91% of people who try it once
will come back.

1319 3900062 1876
- Now, if you'll allow me...
- Excuse me one second.

1320 3902064 2335
What sound is he making? Is that like a tsk?

1321 3907403 1667
It wasn't a tsk.

1322 3909238 1334
It was...

1323 3911490 1835
Like a glottal stop.

1324 3913826 1834
Almost a gag reflex.

1325 3917246 1751
Guys, what is this?

1326 3919081 2669
There was one more meeting scheduled
for the New York trip.

1327 3921834 1334
Yes, it was a dinner.

1328 3923252 1417
It was set up through
my girlfriend at the time.

1329 3924837 3002
Would you say that Mark was
excited about this meeting?

1330 3927924 2251
Yes. Very.

1331 3930259 2001
- Look, they're not gonna card us.
- They might.

1332 3932345 1834
- I mean, look around.
- It'll be embarrassing.

1333 3934305 2793
- Tell him they're not gonna card us.
- They're not gonna card us.

1334 3937183 1917
- Mark...
- Are you gonna talk about ads again?

1335 3939185 1751
Unless you're the ballet theater of Hartford,

1336 3941020 2001
the purpose of a business
is to make a profit.

1337 3943105 1167
It isn't a business yet.

1338 3944357 3794
That's tough for me, 'cause my...
Never mind.

1339 3951155 1375
He's 25 minutes late.

1340 3952615 2752
He founded Napster when he was 19.
He can be late.

1341 3955493 1625
- He's not a god.
- Then what is he?

1342 3957203 1500
He's 25 minutes late.

1343 3958788 1250
I think Wardo's jealous.

1344 3960206 3127
I honestly wasn't jealous. I was nervous.

1345 3963542 1000
Why?

1346 3964669 3460
Well, I didn't know him at all, but I had
done a search and I'd asked around.

1347 3968214 3294
And he struck me as kind of a...

1348 3973386 1458
A wild card.

1349 3975054 1000
Why?

1350 3976180 3294
He crashed out of two pretty big
Internet companies in spectacular fashion,

1351 3979558 1418
he's had a reputation with drugs...

1352 3981060 1250
He also founded the companies.

1353 3982395 1333
We don't need him.

1354 3984355 1042
He's here.

1355 3988567 1584
No, no, take your time.

1356 3990236 2752
- And he does own a watch.
- Stop it.

1357 3994865 1209
- I'm Sean Parker.
- How do you do?

1358 3996158 2919
You must be Eduardo. And Christy.
And Mark.

1359 3999203 1959
- Great to meet you.
- Great to meet you.

1360 4001247 1500
You guys don't have anything
in front of you.

1361 4002873 1042
- No.
- Tori.

1362 4004000 1000
We were waiting.

1363 4005084 2168
- Hey, baby boy.
- Can you bring out some things?

1364 4007378 2793
The lacquered pork with that ginger confit.
Tuna tartare?

1365 4010256 1834
And the lobster claws, that'll get us started.

1366 4012216 1876
Christy, what do you like to drink?

1367 4015720 1208
An appletini.

1368 4017013 2042
Great. Four of those.

1369 4019765 2669
From that point on, it was a Seanathon.

1370 4031277 2668
The question was,
"What did you talk about?"

1371 4045416 2293
He took us through his episode
with Napster.

1372 4047793 3002
I didn't wanna spend my 20s
as a professional defendant.

1373 4050921 3044
Who knew? The music industry
doesn't have a sense of humor.

1374 4054091 3211
We tried to sell the company to pay the
35 million they said we owed in royalties,

1375 4057428 4462
but I guess to them that was a little like
selling a stolen car to pay for the stolen gas.

1376 4062600 2460
So we said screw it, declared bankruptcy.

1377 4065144 2668
- But you made a name for yourself.
- And you are dry.

1378 4067897 1750
- Tori!
- No, no, I'm good.

1379 4069732 2209
And then he went on to
his second business venture,

1380 4072485 3168
which was an online Rolodex that
he got thrown out of by Case Equity.

1381 4075988 1751
And I wanted to do it nice this time.

1382 4078157 3586
I put on a tie and I shined my shoes,
but nobody wants to take orders from a kid.

1383 4081827 2919
So let me tell you what happens to
a 20-year-old at the top of a hot dot-com.

1384 4084830 3169
- I'm not a psychiatrist, but...
- I'm glad we've got that on the record.

1385 4088084 2251
You're not a psychiatrist, but what?

1386 4090461 2835
A psychiatrist would say
that he was paranoid.

1387 4093506 2418
They'll hire private detectives
who'll follow you day and night.

1388 4096008 2085
You're a target for high-priced escorts.

1389 4098177 2335
I can't prove it,
but I know they tap my phones.

1390 4100638 2543
Whatever it is that's gonna trip you up,
you've done already.

1391 4103307 2543
Private behavior is a relic
of a time gone by.

1392 4105935 2835
And if somehow, someway, you've managed
to live your life like the Dalai Lama,

1393 4108854 1167
they'll make shit up.

1394 4110147 2543
Because they don't want you,
they want your idea.

1395 4113025 1501
And they want you
to say "thank you" while you...

1396 4114985 1042
Excuse me.

1397 4116112 1417
...wipe your chin and walk away.

1398 4117655 1041
That's what happened to you?

1399 4118823 1542
And delusional.

1400 4121033 3086
Yes. But there'll be payback at Case.

1401 4124203 1584
I brought down the record companies
with Napster

1402 4125871 1334
and Case'll suffer for their sins, too.

1403 4127289 2502
Sorry, you didn't bring down
the record companies.

1404 4130209 1000
They won.

1405 4131377 1667
- In court.
- Yeah.

1406 4133379 2585
You wanna buy a Tower Records, Eduardo?

1407 4138384 3419
And he told story after story
about life in Silicon Valley,

1408 4141887 4003
and parties at Stanford and down in LA,
and friends who'd become millionaires...

1409 4146016 4879
But mostly how Mark had to...
He had to come to California.

1410 4151814 2335
And then he got around to The Facebook.

1411 4154233 2501
So, tell me about your progress.

1412 4156819 3586
Well, we're in 29 schools now.
We got over 75,000 members.

1413 4160573 1667
- Tell me about the strategy you're using.
- Okay.

1414 4162408 1917
For instance, we wanted Baylor, in Texas,

1415 4164410 1834
but Baylor already had
a social network on campus.

1416 4166370 1542
So instead of going right after them,

1417 4168038 2043
we made a list of every school
within 100 miles...

1418 4170207 1042
You put The Facebook
on those campuses first.

1419 4171333 2836
Pretty soon all the Baylor kids saw
their friends on our site and we were in.

1420 4174253 1334
It's called the Little Bighorn.
That's smart, Mark.

1421 4175713 1375
- Thanks, that was mine.
- Easy.

1422 4177173 1750
Hey, you know what?
Settle an argument for us.

1423 4179049 1876
I say it's time to start making money
from The Facebook,

1424 4181051 1876
but Mark doesn't want advertising.
Who's right?

1425 4183012 1250
Well...

1426 4184930 1251
Neither of you yet.

1427 4186265 2335
The Facebook is cool,
that's what it's got going for it.

1428 4188726 1041
Yeah.

1429 4189852 1667
You don't wanna ruin it with ads
because ads aren't cool.

1430 4191604 1083
Exactly.

1431 4192771 1501
It's like you're throwing
the greatest party on campus

1432 4194356 1251
and someone's saying
it's gotta be over by 11:00.

1433 4195733 1041
That's exactly right.

1434 4196859 2168
- You don't even know what the thing is yet.
- Exactly.

1435 4199111 3711
How big it can get, how far it can go.
This is no time to take your chips down.

1436 4202907 1917
A million dollars isn't cool.
You know what's cool?

1437 4204909 1041
You?

1438 4208746 1333
"A billion dollars."

1439 4213709 1584
And that shut everybody up.

1440 4215377 3086
And that's where you're headed.
A billion-dollar valuation.

1441 4219215 2668
Unless you take bad advice, in which case
you may as well have come up with

1442 4221967 1834
a chain of very successful yogurt shops.

1443 4224345 3669
When you go fishing, you can catch
a lot of fish or you can catch a big fish.

1444 4228098 3294
You ever walk into a guy's den and see
a picture of him standing next to 14 trout?

1445 4231477 1834
- No, he's holding a 3,000-pound marlin.
- Yep.

1446 4233395 1084
- That's a good analogy.
- Okay.

1447 4234563 2377
But we all know marlins don't really
weigh 3,000 pounds, right?

1448 4237024 1042
Have you seen the big ones up close?

1449 4238150 2960
No, but I don't think the guy's holding
a marlin the size of a Range Rover.

1450 4241195 2626
That would be a really big fish
and a very strong guy.

1451 4243906 1542
You think we might be getting away
from the point?

1452 4245532 4295
I don't have a dog in this fight.
I'm just a fan who came to say hi.

1453 4249912 1834
He owned Mark after that dinner.

1454 4252665 2376
He picked up the check,
he told Mark they'd talk again soon,

1455 4255125 1084
and he was gone.

1456 4256293 3878
But not before he made his biggest
contribution to the company.

1457 4262549 2460
Drop the "The." Just "Facebook."

1458 4265594 1542
It's cleaner.

1459 4270057 1042
Shit.

1460 4273811 1041
Goodbye, sweetie.

1461 4275896 1209
Yeah.

1462 4280985 2918
That's gotta be some kind of
land speed record for talking.

1463 4283988 2167
You wanna end the party at 11:00.

1464 4287116 3252
- I'm trying to pay for the party.
- There won't be a party unless it's cool.

1465 4291578 1084
So, what do you think?

1466 4292746 1960
Yeah, sure, let's drop the "The."

1467 4294790 3127
I meant to catching the marlin
instead of the 14 trout.

1468 4298002 1292
Doesn't that sound good?

1469 4299378 1709
If you're a trout.

1470 4301255 1459
I'm going to enter this into the record.

1471 4302798 3920
Incorporation papers for Facebook,
an LLC registered in Florida.

1472 4306802 2084
- Why Florida?
- It's where my family lives.

1473 4308971 2585
And ask the respondent to stipulate
that the articles of incorporation

1474 4311724 3669
state the ownership as follows:
65% for Mark Zuckerberg,

1475 4315477 3127
30% for Eduardo Saverin
and 5% for Dustin Moskovitz.

1476 4318689 1083
Yeah, we stipulate.

1477 4319857 2877
- And that was April 13th, 2004.
- You can mark it.

1478 4322818 1626
You have anything here?

1479 4324528 1292
Yes. Thank you.

1480 4325904 2710
Mr. Saverin, have you ever done anything

1481 4328699 2585
that might be considered
legitimate grounds for termination?

1482 4333120 1042
No.

1483 4334246 4545
You never did anything to embarrass the
company or even seriously jeopardize it?

1484 4339418 1375
- No.
- No?

1485 4344381 1042
No.

1486 4345507 2168
You were accused of animal cruelty.

1487 4349261 2460
- Wait.
- You weren't?

1488 4351805 2252
This is not happening.

1489 4354141 2335
I have here an article from The Crimson...

1490 4356560 1083
Jesus Christ.

1491 4357728 1042
I can't have this, Wardo.

1492 4358854 3461
Come on, man. This is bullshit.
This is another club playing a prank.

1493 4363859 2251
I'd gotten into the Phoenix.

1494 4366195 2626
I'd been accepted,
and as part of my initiation I had to,

1495 4368906 4003
for one week, carry with me at all times
and take care of a chicken.

1496 4372993 2627
They identify you
as one of the founders of Facebook.

1497 4375704 1376
"Junior Eduardo Saverin..."

1498 4377164 1959
I'm not the expert, but being connected
to torturing animals

1499 4379208 1333
is probably bad for business.

1500 4380626 4837
I did not torture the chicken.
I don't torture chickens. Are you crazy?

1501 4385547 3837
No, and settle down, please.
I have here an article from The Crimson...

1502 4389468 1792
- This is scathing.
- 956.

1503 4391428 2752
I was having dinner in
the Kirkland dining hall with Mark,

1504 4394598 1375
and I had the chicken with me,

1505 4396058 2001
because I had to have the chicken
with me at all times.

1506 4398143 1084
This was college.

1507 4399311 2085
- Somebody's gonna have to answer for this.
- 969.

1508 4401855 2168
And the dining hall
was serving chicken for dinner,

1509 4404108 2418
and I had to feed my chicken, so I...

1510 4406610 3211
Well, I took little pieces of chicken
and I gave it to the chicken.

1511 4410406 1667
Someone must have seen me,
because the next thing I knew

1512 4412157 1709
I was being accused of forced cannibalism.

1513 4414827 2501
I didn't know you couldn't do that.

1514 4417746 2001
I dealt with the various animal rights groups,

1515 4419832 2209
I dealt with the associate dean
of the college.

1516 4422334 1667
This was all resolved.

1517 4424086 1042
988.

1518 4425212 2043
Someone from the Porc or the Fly
must have reported it.

1519 4427339 1834
For all I know, it was the Winklevosses.

1520 4429258 1709
All right, let's just forget about it.

1521 4431051 2960
This is absurd.
I'm being accused of animal cruelty.

1522 4434096 1459
It's better to be accused of necrophilia.

1523 4435639 1626
It is better to be accused of necrophilia.

1524 4437349 3377
Now I have to explain this to my father.
I'm gonna have to explain this to everybody.

1525 4440811 1417
What is happening on that?

1526 4442312 2085
I have my final coming up
for Postwar and Contemporary Art

1527 4444481 1250
and I haven't been to class.

1528 4445816 1250
I'm supposed to write about
these four paintings.

1529 4447443 1333
That's a Facebook page?

1530 4448861 1041
Yeah. I opened it under an alias.

1531 4449987 1417
I posted the paintings
and asked people to comment.

1532 4451488 3002
Every once in a while, I hop on
and stir the pot to get a good debate going.

1533 4454575 2418
Mr. Zuckerberg was cheating
on his final exam?

1534 4457077 2794
- I'd rather not answer that, Gretchen.
- And why not?

1535 4459955 2752
Because I'm not suing him
for cheating on his final exam.

1536 4462791 3169
- That's not what friends do.
- Well, you just told us he was cheating.

1537 4466879 1041
Oops.

1538 4470257 1959
You told your lawyers
I was torturing animals?

1539 4472301 1625
No, he didn't tell us about it at all.

1540 4474011 2751
Our litigators are capable
of finding a Crimson article.

1541 4476847 2710
In fact, when we raised the subject with him,
he defended you.

1542 4482019 1041
Oops.

1543 4483479 2042
993. We are so close.

1544 4486148 3169
Yeah, that reminds me,
we're gonna need more money, Wardo.

1545 4489401 2043
Yeah, no, I agree. More servers, more help.

1546 4491528 1751
I'm interviewing two interns
to come to Palo Alto

1547 4493363 1084
and we're gonna have
to pay them something.

1548 4494531 1960
- Sorry, what?
- I already found a house for rent

1549 4496575 1751
on a street
two blocks from the Stanford campus.

1550 4498410 1334
It is perfect and it's got a pool.

1551 4499828 2001
When did you decide to go to California
for the summer?

1552 4501914 1250
You mean when did I actually decide?

1553 4503248 3169
Was it somewhere in the middle
of the Sean Parker Variety Hour?

1554 4506835 2210
He was right,
California's the place we've gotta be.

1555 4509129 1417
What, you're Jed Clampett?

1556 4510631 2042
I didn't know you guys
got The Beverly Hillbillies in Brazil.

1557 4512758 1667
Yeah, got the show in Brazil, it was genius.

1558 4514885 2960
- What is your problem with Sean?
- He doesn't bring anything to the table.

1559 4517930 2042
He doesn't have money.
Dustin's a better programmer.

1560 4520057 3586
- He's got connections to VCs.
- We don't need VCs, we need advertisers.

1561 4523727 1918
- And I have connections to VCs.
- No real players.

1562 4525729 2585
And as somebody who's just really
embarrassed the company in a bad way...

1563 4528398 2210
- It was the Winklevosses, Mark.
- Hang on.

1564 4530692 1459
Hit "Refresh."

1565 4532861 3127
150,004.

1566 4536073 2376
150,000 members, Wardo.

1567 4538825 1334
- Congratulations, dude.
- Congratulations.

1568 4540869 3836
You don't think it was strange that
he was followed by private detectives?

1569 4544790 1667
Who came up with nothing.

1570 4546542 1959
Enough to get him out of the company.
The drugs, the girls.

1571 4548585 2126
- We don't know that any of that's true.
- You can read about it.

1572 4550796 1542
I can read about you torturing birds.
Since when...

1573 4552422 3670
Okay, don't fish eat other fish?
The marlins and the trout?

1574 4558595 1042
What's he talking about?

1575 4559721 2669
I'm interviewing interns at 10:00
tomorrow night in the CS lab.

1576 4562474 1167
Get on board with this, man.

1577 4563725 2544
You know, I don't really know
what else to say.

1578 4589626 2377
You can do one more! One more!

1579 4596717 1041
Wardo!

1580 4597843 1292
Yo! Mark!

1581 4601054 1042
What's going on?

1582 4602180 2377
They have 10 minutes to get root access
to a Python web server,

1583 4604641 1292
expose its SSL encryption,

1584 4606018 1625
and then intercept all traffic
over its secure port.

1585 4607769 1042
They're hacking.

1586 4608937 2001
Yes, all behind a Pix Firewall Emulator.
But here's the beauty.

1587 4611023 1834
You know I didn't understand
anything you just said, right?

1588 4612941 1125
- I do know that.
- So what's the beauty?

1589 4614151 1917
Every tenth line of code written,
they have to drink a shot.

1590 4616153 3002
Hacking's supposed to be stealth,
so every time the server detects an intrusion,

1591 4619239 1834
the candidate responsible
has to drink a shot.

1592 4621158 1709
I also have a program running
that has a pop-up window

1593 4622951 1834
appear simultaneously on all five computers.

1594 4624870 2001
The last candidate to hit the window
has to drink a shot.

1595 4626955 2126
Plus, every three minutes
they all have to drink a shot.

1596 4629166 2460
- Three minutes!
- Drink one now!

1597 4631710 3628
Hey, can I ask, what part of the intern's job
will they need to be able to do drunk?

1598 4635422 1042
You're right.

1599 4636548 3294
A more relevant test might be seeing
if they can keep a chicken alive for a week.

1600 4641637 1917
- That was mean.
- Here.

1601 4643722 1042
What is this?

1602 4644848 3085
I opened a new account
and put $18,000 in it.

1603 4649394 1876
Will that get you through the summer?

1604 4651355 1041
- Here!
- Mark?

1605 4652481 1417
Right here!

1606 4659071 1834
Welcome to Facebook.

1607 4670290 1709
- $18,000?
- Yes.

1608 4672084 2334
In addition to the $1,000
you'd already put up.

1609 4674503 2585
- Yes.
- A total of $19,000 now.

1610 4677172 1250
- Yes.
- Hang on.

1611 4680592 1459
I'm just checking your math on that.

1612 4682135 2335
Yes, I got the same thing.

1613 4685055 1083
May I continue?

1614 4686723 2919
After expressing misgivings
about Mr. Zuckerberg taking the company

1615 4689726 2043
and moving it to California for the summer,

1616 4691853 3002
why did you put $18,000
in an account for his use?

1617 4694940 3753
I figured we were partners.
I wanted to be a team player.

1618 4698777 3085
I figured Mark, Dustin and the new interns
could work on the site

1619 4701947 2460
while I was generating
advertiser interest in New York.

1620 4704491 4545
But mostly I figured, how much could
possibly go wrong in three months?

1621 4710831 1792
Go, go, go, go, go.

1622 4717212 1626
- I didn't die.
- I know.

1623 4718922 1834
- I made it.
- You did.

1624 4722175 1334
Okay, ready?

1625 4723593 2252
- That was like an 8.
- That was like a 2.

1626 4725929 2376
- It was better than that.
- Yeah.

1627 4736982 1041
I'm okay.

1628 4738108 1250
- You sure?
- Yeah.

1629 4739985 1083
Yikes.

1630 4742446 1375
That's the doorbell.

1631 4743905 1209
I didn't know we had a doorbell.

1632 4745198 2710
- Andrew, get the door!
- No, he's wired in.

1633 4747993 2001
That's gonna cut into your security deposit.

1634 4752080 1084
- Andrew.
- Not now.

1635 4753248 1334
Good boy.

1636 4758712 1333
- Sean?
- Mark?

1637 4760130 1959
- Do you live here?
- Yeah.

1638 4762382 1042
Do you?

1639 4763508 1542
We were right across the street.
We saw the chimney...

1640 4765135 2585
- Is anybody hurt?
- No. You live across the street?

1641 4769139 1167
I'm Sharon.

1642 4770390 2335
This is my... Sharon.
She lives across the street.

1643 4772851 1292
I was helping her move out,
we saw the chimney...

1644 4774227 1960
We had a zip line to the pool.

1645 4777063 2460
You came to California.

1646 4780025 1000
Yeah.

1647 4781109 2126
You made the right choice.

1648 4789201 1000
Here you go.

1649 4794873 1042
Sharon?

1650 4798376 1000
I'm so sorry.

1651 4799461 1042
- No problem.
- I didn't know you were gonna...

1652 4800587 2043
- Here you go.
- No, no, no. Wait!

1653 4804049 4044
This house and this team are great.
It's exactly what it should be.

1654 4808887 1334
I'm Sean Parker.

1655 4810305 1125
Oh, he's wired in.

1656 4811973 1668
That's what I'm talking about.

1657 4815227 1125
Where's Eduardo?

1658 4816436 2502
He got an internship in New York.

1659 4819606 1375
Eduardo didn't come out?

1660 4841586 2710
I was crashing there for a little bit
while I'm taking care of some things,

1661 4844422 3420
but she's done for the summer
so she's back at her parents' place.

1662 4847926 3461
- The homeless rock star of Palo Alto.
- All right.

1663 4851471 2460
What's your plan for the summer?

1664 4855100 1208
Mark?

1665 4856935 2168
I'm sorry. I was looking at the architecture.

1666 4860438 1334
I asked what your plan for the...

1667 4861857 1500
A hundred schools
by the end of the summer.

1668 4863441 1751
- We're gonna go to the restroom.
- Okay.

1669 4865318 2001
Yeah, I'll go with you.

1670 4870949 1500
Your date looks so familiar to me.

1671 4872534 1584
She looks familiar to a lot of people.

1672 4874202 1250
What do you mean?

1673 4877455 3378
A Stanford MBA named Roy Raymond
wants to buy his wife some lingerie,

1674 4880959 2793
but he's too embarrassed
to shop for it in a department store.

1675 4883837 1834
He comes up with an idea
for a high-end place

1676 4885797 2293
that doesn't make you feel like a pervert.

1677 4888174 4003
He gets a $40,000 bank loan,
borrows another 40,000 from his in-laws,

1678 4892304 2960
opens a store and calls it Victoria's Secret.

1679 4895348 2710
Makes a half million dollars his first year.

1680 4898143 3836
Starts a catalog, opens three more stores,
and after five years, he sells the company

1681 4902063 3253
to Leslie Wexner and The Limited
for $4 million.

1682 4905483 1167
Happy ending, right?

1683 4907193 4254
Except two years later,
the company's worth $500 million,

1684 4911531 3294
and Roy Raymond jumps off
the Golden Gate Bridge.

1685 4917037 3794
Poor guy just wanted to buy his wife
a pair of thigh-highs, you know?

1686 4922000 1417
Was that a parable?

1687 4924210 4212
My date's a Victoria's Secret model.
That's why she looks familiar to you.

1688 4928506 1459
- God.
- Don't be impressed by all this.

1689 4930050 1250
I read your blog.

1690 4931384 2043
You know, no, that was for web cretins.

1691 4933511 1668
You know why I started Napster?

1692 4936348 4795
The girl I loved in high school was with
the co-captain of the varsity lacrosse team,

1693 4941227 2043
and I wanted to take her from him.

1694 4943355 1917
So I decided to come up with
the next big thing.

1695 4945690 2543
- I didn't know that.
- Napster wasn't a failure.

1696 4948360 3419
I changed the music industry
for better and for always.

1697 4951863 4253
It may not have been good business,
but it pissed a lot of people off.

1698 4956201 2460
And isn't that what your Facemash
was about?

1699 4958745 2668
They're scared of me, pal,
and they're gonna be scared of you.

1700 4961539 1751
What the VCs want is to say,

1701 4963375 2835
"Good idea, kid,
the grown-ups will take it from here."

1702 4966294 2627
But not this time. This is our time.

1703 4969381 3460
This time, you're gonna hand them
a business card that says,

1704 4972926 1709
"I'm CEO, bitch."

1705 4975887 1834
That's what I want for you.

1706 4978431 1626
So where the hell is Eduardo?

1707 4981226 2460
- He's in New York.
- Sucking up to ad execs.

1708 4983770 1959
- He's got an...
- An internship.

1709 4986898 3503
The company's here.
A billion-dollar company's here.

1710 4991820 1542
- Do you live and breathe Facebook?
- Yes.

1711 4993446 1125
I know you do.

1712 4994656 3085
Wardo wants to be a businessman
and for all I know he's gonna be a good one,

1713 4997826 2751
but he shouldn't be in New York
kissing Madison Avenue's ass.

1714 5002580 3169
This is a once-in-a-generation,
"holy shit" idea.

1715 5006084 3669
And the water under
the Golden Gate is freezing cold.

1716 5011464 4128
Look at my face and tell me
I don't know what I'm talking about.

1717 5017303 1543
Do you ever think about that girl?

1718 5018930 1042
What girl?

1719 5020098 3336
The girl from high school
with the lacrosse thing.

1720 5024769 1000
No.

1721 5025854 3544
If you guys are gonna talk about bandwidth,
we need shots.

1722 5029482 1501
A hundred schools
by the end of the summer?

1723 5031109 1000
Yeah.

1724 5032193 1376
Tell you what. Gesture of good faith.

1725 5033653 4462
While you're getting into 100 schools,
I'll put you on two continents.

1726 5039284 1083
Two...

1727 5044831 1459
If you don't have a place to crash,

1728 5046374 2293
I think you should definitely
come and live with us.

1729 5049627 1918
Let's line up some shots.

1730 5051629 2127
- Excuse me!
- Yes, sir.

1731 5053840 3127
You can take this away
and bring back the 1942.

1732 5057052 1917
Absolutely, Mr. Parker.

1733 5075153 3002
Attention... Go!

1734 5095006 4504
At the barrier, Hollandia is
leading Harvard University by one length.

1735 5109354 1167
Approaching the grandstands,

1736 5110605 3127
Hollandia maintains a lead
of three-quarters of a length.

1737 5126955 1250
Come on!

1738 5166870 1333
Whatever.

1739 5173877 1041
- Mr. Winklevoss.
- Tyler.

1740 5175044 1835
- Tremendous race.
- Thank you.

1741 5176963 2251
- And this is my brother, Cameron.
- Excellent.

1742 5179299 1041
Sir?

1743 5180425 1709
His Royal Highness Prince Albert.

1744 5182260 1751
Your Highness, this is
Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss.

1745 5184095 3336
Of course. Brilliant race.
I've never seen a race that close.

1746 5187557 1000
Yes, Your Highness.

1747 5188641 3044
My grandfather, Jack Kelly,
was one of the premier rowers of his day.

1748 5191769 3461
I've been coming to Henley for 30 years
and I'd never seen a race that close.

1749 5195607 1625
Have you? Have you seen a race that close?

1750 5197317 1083
No, Your Highness.

1751 5198484 2377
Mile-and-a-half races are more
commonly won by a boat length or two.

1752 5200945 2794
Yes, that's absolutely right. Brutally close.

1753 5203948 1042
May I introduce my teammates?

1754 5205116 1918
I'm sorry. You'll have to excuse us.

1755 5207118 1667
On to the Dutch.

1756 5212290 1375
Sorry you flew all the way out here
to see that.

1757 5213791 2127
Wouldn't have missed it, brother.
How was the royalty?

1758 5216002 2627
I just wanted him to tell me
a couple more times how close the race was.

1759 5218755 3502
Just brutal, brutally close.
Brutally excruciating. Jesus.

1760 5222342 1667
The guy is the prince of a country
the size of Nantucket.

1761 5224135 1000
Relax, it's fine.

1762 5225261 1167
- Boys. Divya.
- Dad.

1763 5226512 2043
- Mr. Winklevoss.
- That was a tough beat.

1764 5228640 2084
I'm sorry that you and Mom
had to fly out here to see that.

1765 5230808 1835
No, don't ever apologize to me
for losing a race like that.

1766 5233019 2627
Don't ever apologize to anyone
for losing a race like that.

1767 5235772 1834
- Boys.
- Mr. Kenwright.

1768 5238274 2669
Dad, this is Mr. Kenwright,
head of the host family for this week.

1769 5241027 1751
- Pleasure to meet you.
- Good to meet you.

1770 5242862 1417
I've just had a phone chat with my daughter.

1771 5244364 2960
She told me that she and her friends
are already talking about the race,

1772 5247450 2251
which they've just seen via their computers.

1773 5249827 3837
A new website called Facebook.
Do you have this in America?

1774 5254999 2168
I'm gonna find your mother.

1775 5258711 1042
Have I said something wrong?

1776 5259837 1876
Your daughter doesn't go
to school in the States?

1777 5261839 1292
No, no. Cambridge.

1778 5263216 2752
Majoring in French literature, though
I wasn't aware there was such a thing.

1779 5266052 1083
And they have Facebook at Cambridge?

1780 5267220 2084
And apparently Oxford and
the London School of Economics.

1781 5269389 1083
That's where her friends are.

1782 5271057 1500
That's awesome.

1783 5273017 3503
Good race, boys.
Take the bitter with the better, eh?

1784 5278856 1376
I'm gonna go watch the race film.

1785 5283569 2293
If this is online, I wanna see it.

1786 5285989 1333
Stop it.

1787 5287865 1501
Stop it, Cam.

1788 5289742 1501
Knock it off.

1789 5291828 2543
I don't mind that we lost
to the Dutch today by less than a second.

1790 5294497 2168
That was a good race,
and that was a fair race.

1791 5296749 1459
And they'll see us again.

1792 5298334 2126
What I mind, and what you should mind,

1793 5300545 3169
is showing up on Monday
for a race that was run on Sunday.

1794 5304257 1917
We tried talking to him ourselves,
we tried writing a letter,

1795 5306259 3586
we tried the Ad Board, and we tried
talking to the president of the university.

1796 5309929 2502
Now, I am asking you for the last time,

1797 5312557 5171
let's take the considerable resources
at our disposal and sue him in federal court.

1798 5318187 1251
Come on.

1799 5320857 1834
I need a real drink.

1800 5329574 1000
Screw it.

1801 5332035 2209
Let's gut the friggin' nerd.

1802 5337081 1334
That's what I'm talking about!

1803 5338583 1834
No, no, no, no, no.

1804 5340585 2251
But check it out, I saw him today.

1805 5342920 2419
Manningham, Mitchell Manningham,
my Case Equity guy.

1806 5345423 1083
Hang on.

1807 5346591 1667
Are you guys using Spikes
or Ghost Missiles?

1808 5348343 1667
We don't know,
we're just shooting at each other.

1809 5350094 1417
Use Sweet Kamikazes.

1810 5351596 2126
Like we know what that is.

1811 5354223 3795
I saw him getting into his Turbo Carrera
and he saw me, too.

1812 5358102 1584
I know he did.

1813 5362106 2961
Don't. Don't sweat it. I'm on a landline.

1814 5365234 1334
Bong hit.

1815 5367278 1501
Does anybody hear that banging?

1816 5368863 2418
You don't hear anything.
You're writing code.

1817 5371366 2001
Dude, somebody's at the door.

1818 5373451 4587
It's not a dish best served cold.
It's best served immediately and relentlessly.

1819 5381751 1834
I'm gonna call you back.

1820 5385588 2502
What's up?

1821 5389801 1750
Mark was supposed to pick me up
at the airport an hour ago.

1822 5391636 1584
I've been calling his cell.

1823 5393304 4504
He was on a 36-hour coding tear,
so he took a nap for a couple of hours.

1824 5404065 1083
What happened here?

1825 5405274 3461
Not happened. Happening.
The next big thing.

1826 5408820 1166
Wardo.

1827 5410071 1000
Hey, man.

1828 5411155 2001
- Back to work.
- Okay.

1829 5413241 2918
The more bad I get at this,
the more wasted I get.

1830 5416285 1501
I mean the more wasted that I get...

1831 5418162 1417
We understand.

1832 5421958 1125
How old are they, Sean?

1833 5423668 1333
It's not polite to ask.

1834 5425086 1167
Sean, how old are they?

1835 5427505 1334
You think you know me, right?

1836 5428965 1208
I've read enough.

1837 5430299 2335
You know how much I've read about you?

1838 5433177 1334
Nothing.

1839 5438349 1751
- Wardo.
- Hey, man.

1840 5440184 2919
- I waited an hour for you at the airport.
- What time is it?

1841 5443187 3336
It's midnight. Or 3:00 a.m. In New York,
where I just came from.

1842 5446607 3670
You gotta see some of the new stuff we got.
Hey, Dustin. Show him the Wall.

1843 5450361 1084
I'm just calling it the Wall.

1844 5451529 2585
Forget the Wall, tell him about
the meeting I've got set up.

1845 5454198 1584
You know Peter Thiel?

1846 5455867 1333
- Nope.
- No reason you should.

1847 5457285 3252
He just runs a $2-billion hedge fund
called Clarium Capital.

1848 5462039 1584
Why's he setting up meetings?

1849 5463708 1083
Thiel might wanna make
an angel investment.

1850 5464876 3085
I don't care if he's an actual angel.
Why is he setting up business meetings?

1851 5468045 2669
- You've had a long flight.
- No, I had a long wait on the tarmac at JFK,

1852 5470798 2251
then a long wait at the passenger
loading and unloading zone at SFO,

1853 5473176 1875
and in between there was a long flight.

1854 5475178 1709
I'm the business end of this company.

1855 5477638 2418
And he is a houseguest living here rent free

1856 5480183 2876
on a very generous grant
from the Eduardo Saverin Foundation.

1857 5483186 3294
I heard about your big-ticket ad buys.
Gary's Tuxedos.

1858 5486564 1667
- Hey, man...
- Harvard Bartending Course.

1859 5488316 3210
You're just a small step away
from bagging Snookies Cookies, I can feel it.

1860 5500703 2293
- You wanna talk to me alone for a minute?
- Sure.

1861 5507335 1333
Bong hit.

1862 5508753 2293
- I'm so high.
- No, you're not.

1863 5511589 1751
So how's it going?

1864 5513674 2669
How's the internship? How's Christy?

1865 5517345 2334
- How's the internship?
- Yeah.

1866 5521224 1959
Mark, Jesus, I quit the internship.

1867 5523267 2502
We talked about this on the phone.
I quit on my first day.

1868 5527396 2377
I do remember you saying that.

1869 5529941 1792
So how is Christy?

1870 5532109 1668
Christy's crazy.

1871 5534070 1709
- Is that fun?
- No.

1872 5535863 1000
I mean, she's actually psychotic.

1873 5536948 5170
She's insanely jealous, she's irrational,
and I'm frightened of her.

1874 5542787 1292
Still, it's nice you have a girlfriend.

1875 5547625 4086
I do not want that guy representing
himself as part of this company.

1876 5551796 2168
You gotta move out here, Wardo,
this is where it's all happening.

1877 5554048 2001
- Did you hear what I just said?
- The connections, the energy...

1878 5556133 1000
Mark, you got...

1879 5557260 2543
I'm afraid if you don't come out here,
you're gonna get left behind.

1880 5559887 2335
I want... I need you out here.

1881 5562306 1918
- Please don't tell him I said that.
- What did you just say?

1882 5564308 2085
It's moving faster than any of us
ever imagined it would.

1883 5566477 1751
- It's moving fast.
- What did you mean?

1884 5568312 1918
- And Sean thinks we have...
- Sean is not part of this company.

1885 5570314 1084
We have over 300,000 members, Wardo,

1886 5571482 2168
and we're in 160 schools,
including five in Europe.

1887 5573734 1501
I'm aware of that! Mark, I am the CFO!

1888 5575319 1417
We need more servers
than I ever expected we'd need.

1889 5576821 1584
We need more programmers
and we need more money,

1890 5578489 2502
and he set up the Thiel meeting.
He set up meetings all over town.

1891 5581117 1208
- He set up other meetings?
- Yes.

1892 5582410 1750
- Without me knowing anything about it.
- You're in New York.

1893 5584287 3877
I'm in New York riding subways
14 hours a day, trying to find advertisers!

1894 5588291 1667
And how's it going so far?

1895 5594422 2501
What did you mean, "get left behind"?

1896 5601637 1376
- Hi.
- Can I help you?

1897 5603097 1501
I'd like to freeze this bank account

1898 5604682 3461
and cancel all existing checks
and lines of credit.

1899 5609478 3169
- May I see some ID, please?
- Yeah, sure, sorry.

1900 5619447 1250
Sean, he'll be right with you.

1901 5620781 1417
No problem.

1902 5624035 2251
You know this is where
they filmed Towering Inferno?

1903 5626370 1751
That's comforting.

1904 5629540 1751
Hey, guys. Come on back.

1905 5632793 2252
- She offer you some waters?
- Oh, yeah. We're cool.

1906 5636631 1250
Sean, how are you? Come on in.

1907 5637965 1918
- You must be Mark.
- Hi.

1908 5641677 3336
We took a look at everything,
and congratulations.

1909 5645139 3503
We're gonna start you off
with a $500,000 investment.

1910 5649060 3669
Maurice is gonna talk to you
about some corporate restructuring.

1911 5652855 2043
We'll file as a corporation in Delaware

1912 5654982 2919
and come up with a stock structure
that allows for new investors.

1913 5657985 2335
Now, let me ask you something.

1914 5660488 1917
Who's Eduardo Saverin?

1915 5682760 1250
Jesus Christ.

1916 5687598 1084
When did you get back?

1917 5688766 1417
You scared me. I need you to knock.

1918 5690267 1918
When did you get back?

1919 5693270 1668
I got back this afternoon.

1920 5695064 1459
And when were you gonna call me?

1921 5696607 2668
Chris, it was kind of a rough trip
and I was tired...

1922 5699360 3919
Yeah, or answer one of my 47 texts.
Did you know I sent 47 texts?

1923 5703364 3878
I did, and I thought that was
incredibly normal behavior.

1924 5707368 1500
Are you mocking me?

1925 5709078 1208
I brought you a present.

1926 5712123 2835
Why does your Status say "single"
on your Facebook page?

1927 5715084 1042
What?

1928 5716210 3920
Why does your Relationship Status
say "single" on your Facebook page?

1929 5720214 1667
Well, I was single when I set up the page.

1930 5721966 2084
And you just never bothered to change it?

1931 5724135 1083
What?

1932 5725428 1458
I don't know how.

1933 5726971 1834
Do I look stupid to you?

1934 5728931 1292
No, calm down.

1935 5730307 2252
You're asking me to believe
that the CFO of Facebook

1936 5732643 2251
doesn't know how to change
his Relationship Status on Facebook?

1937 5734979 3335
It's embarrassing, so you should take it
as a sign of trust that I would tell you that.

1938 5738441 1208
- Go to hell.
- Take it easy.

1939 5739775 3044
No, you didn't change it so you could
screw those Silicon Valley sluts

1940 5742903 1167
every time you go out to see Mark.

1941 5744155 3002
Not even remotely true, and I can
promise you that the Silicon Valley sluts

1942 5747283 2877
don't care what anyone's
Relationship Status is on Facebook.

1943 5750286 1375
Please, open your present.

1944 5751787 1876
Your phone does work.

1945 5754623 1126
It's Mark.

1946 5755833 2168
Okay, this is gonna be tricky.

1947 5758085 2502
Open your present. It's a silk scarf.

1948 5760671 1667
Have you ever seen me wear a scarf?

1949 5762757 1834
This'll be your first.

1950 5764675 1084
Yeah.

1951 5765843 1250
- You froze our account?
- I did.

1952 5767178 2251
- You froze the account.
- I had to get your attention, Mark.

1953 5769513 1751
Do you realize that you jeopardized
the entire company?

1954 5771348 1584
Do you realize that your actions
could have destroyed

1955 5773017 1000
everything I've been working on?

1956 5774143 1042
We have been working on.

1957 5775269 1501
Without money, the site can't function.

1958 5776854 2251
Let me tell you the difference
between Facebook and everybody else.

1959 5779190 1083
We don't crash ever!

1960 5780357 3670
If the servers are down for even a day, our
entire reputation is irreversibly destroyed.

1961 5784111 2001
- Look...
- Users are fickle. Friendster has proved that.

1962 5786197 2751
Even a few people leaving would reverberate
through the entire user base.

1963 5789033 2334
The users are interconnected.
That is the whole point.

1964 5791452 1751
College kids are online
because their friends are online

1965 5793287 2168
and if one domino goes,
the other dominos go.

1966 5795539 1084
Don't you get that?

1967 5796707 1626
I am not going back to
the Caribbean Night at A-E-Pi!

1968 5800336 1375
Holy shit.

1969 5804548 1334
What is wrong with you?

1970 5806008 1459
Did you like being nobody?

1971 5807551 1751
Did you like being a joke?
Do you wanna go back to that?

1972 5809386 1418
Hang on, hang on, hang on, hang on.

1973 5810888 1334
That was the act of a child,
not a businessman,

1974 5812306 1417
and it certainly was not the act of a friend.

1975 5813849 2543
You know how embarrassing it was for me
to try to cash a check today?

1976 5816477 1250
I am not going back to that life.

1977 5817853 2377
- Maybe you were frustrated.
- Yeah!

1978 5820397 2293
- Maybe you were angry.
- I was!

1979 5822900 2335
But I am willing to let bygones be bygones,

1980 5825361 2293
because, Wardo, I've got some good news.

1981 5827738 1167
I'm sorry.

1982 5828989 4754
I was angry, and maybe it was childish,
but I had to get your attention.

1983 5833869 2794
Wardo, I said I've got some good news.

1984 5837081 1000
What is it?

1985 5838207 2543
Peter Thiel just made an angel investment
of half a million dollars.

1986 5840835 1166
What?

1987 5842211 3961
Half a million dollars.
And he's setting us up in an office.

1988 5846924 2501
They wanna reincorporate the company.
They wanna meet you.

1989 5849552 1458
They need your signature
on some documents,

1990 5851095 2418
so you gotta get your ass
on the first flight back to San Francisco.

1991 5853597 1584
I need my CFO.

1992 5860104 1083
I'm on my way.

1993 5861272 1500
- Wardo?
- Yeah?

1994 5862940 1459
We did it.

1995 5867736 1209
Wardo?

1996 5869530 1917
You're going back there already?

1997 5871574 1125
Yes.

1998 5874451 2168
And also, I'm breaking up with you.

1999 5880457 1793
Somebody stop her!

2000 5884753 1042
Four documents.

2001 5885921 1876
The first two are common stock
purchase agreements,

2002 5887923 3044
allowing you to buy stock
in the newly reincorporated Facebook,

2003 5891051 3419
as opposed to the old shares,
which are now worthless.

2004 5894555 1167
The third is an exchange agreement

2005 5895806 2752
allowing you to exchange
the old shares for new shares,

2006 5898642 2252
and then finally a voter holding agreement.

2007 5900978 1751
How many shares of stock will I own?

2008 5902813 3169
1,328,334.

2009 5906066 1376
Jesus Christ.

2010 5907526 2919
That represents a 34.4% ownership share.

2011 5910946 2335
Why the increase from the original 30%?

2012 5913365 2752
'Cause you may need to dilute it
to award shares to new investors.

2013 5916827 2251
- I love working with business majors.
- I'm telling you.

2014 5919163 1041
- Economics.
- Right.

2015 5920289 4920
You should know that Mark has already
taken his percentage from 60 down to 51.

2016 5926503 3253
Well, Mark doesn't care about money
and he needs to be protected.

2017 5931800 2335
Dustin Moskovitz owns 6.81%.

2018 5934219 2836
Sean Parker, 6.47%.

2019 5939308 1042
I can live with that.

2020 5940434 1834
And Peter Thiel, 7%.

2021 5946649 2293
Would you like to use my pen?

2022 5949193 2960
Eduardo? Eduardo?

2023 5953906 1125
Can you please repeat the question?

2024 5955115 2210
No, it was an outrageously leading question
the first time around,

2025 5957409 1125
and now you want us to hear it twice?

2026 5958619 1876
Yes. Would you read it back, please?

2027 5960579 1042
Well, go ahead.

2028 5961705 1709
"Counsel: 'And when you signed
these documents,

2029 5963499 2751
"'were you aware that you were signing
your own death certificate?"'

2030 5966335 1083
No.

2031 5971840 4129
It was insanely stupid of me not to have
my own lawyers look over all the...

2032 5976053 3169
In all honesty,
I thought they were my lawyers.

2033 5982476 1584
I was your only friend.

2034 5985980 1333
You had one friend.

2035 5992152 1042
My father won't even look at me.

2036 5993278 5088
Okay, Eduardo, did Mr. Zuckerberg say
anything to you after you signed the papers?

2037 5998492 3002
There was a lot of handshaking,
a lot of congratulations.

2038 6002663 1375
He'd already told me that he wouldn't be

2039 6004123 3127
coming back to school
for at least a semester,

2040 6007334 2752
so we were saying goodbye for a while.

2041 6010879 1251
And then before I left he said...

2042 6012214 1083
But you gotta come back.

2043 6013382 2501
Somewhere around the end of November
or early December.

2044 6015968 2460
Peter wants to throw us an amazing party
when we hit a million members.

2045 6018512 1751
It's gonna be out of control.
You gotta come back for it.

2046 6020347 1292
A million members?

2047 6021724 1166
Yeah.

2048 6023392 3294
Remember the algorithm
on the window at Kirkland?

2049 6027604 1209
Yeah.

2050 6032234 1250
Yeah, I'll be here.

2051 6038657 1167
You sure about this?

2052 6039908 1167
You're 20 minutes late.

2053 6041160 1458
You're gonna walk in there
and say you overslept

2054 6042703 1125
and didn't have time to get dressed.

2055 6043912 2168
They're gonna pitch you.
Case Equity is going to pitch you.

2056 6046165 1584
They're gonna beg you to take their money.

2057 6047833 1667
You're gonna nod, you're gonna nod,
you're gonna nod,

2058 6049585 3043
and then you're gonna say,
"Which one of you is Roth?"

2059 6052713 1417
No, not Roth. Manningham.

2060 6054214 2126
"Which one of you is Mitchell Manningham?"
And he'll say, "I am."

2061 6056425 3461
And then you say,
"Sean Parker says, 'Fuck you."'

2062 6060429 1334
Walk out.

2063 6061889 1167
Okay.

2064 6075903 2126
In late November, I got the e-mail from Mark

2065 6078113 2043
telling me to come out
for the millionth-member party.

2066 6080240 1042
What else did the e-mail say?

2067 6081867 2168
It said that we had to have
a business meeting.

2068 6084912 3252
That Mark and Sean had played
some kind of revenge stunt on Case Equity,

2069 6088832 1626
and that Manningham was so impressed

2070 6090542 3920
that he was now making an investment offer
that was hard to turn down.

2071 6094546 4170
So I went to California,
and I went straight to the new offices.

2072 6098801 3711
I didn't know whether to dress for the party
or for the business meeting,

2073 6102596 2376
so I kind of dressed for both.

2074 6105682 1960
- But it didn't matter.
- Why not?

2075 6107726 2210
Because I wasn't called out there
for either one.

2076 6110020 1584
What were you called out there for?

2077 6115442 1376
An ambush.

2078 6117236 1834
Mr. Saverin. Hey. Right over here.

2079 6126203 1042
Hey, man.

2080 6127329 1042
- How are you?
- Good. How are you?

2081 6128455 2710
- Good, good, good, good, good.
- Good to see you.

2082 6131250 3460
At first I thought he was joking.
Giving me more contracts to sign.

2083 6139091 1792
But then I started reading.

2084 6144263 1792
Wait, what is this?

2085 6146390 3252
Well, as you know, we had some
new investors that have come in.

2086 6149768 1042
What is this?

2087 6163115 1459
Mr. Saverin.

2088 6167202 1167
Mark!

2089 6169663 1459
- Mark?
- He's wired in.

2090 6171206 1042
- Sorry?
- He's wired in.

2091 6172332 1459
- Is he?
- Yes.

2092 6175377 2752
- How about now? Are you still wired in?
- Call security.

2093 6178213 1834
You issued 24 million new shares of stock!

2094 6181258 1626
You were told that if new investors
came along...

2095 6182968 3127
How much were your shares diluted?
How much were his?

2096 6186180 3752
What was Mr. Zuckerberg's
ownership share diluted down to?

2097 6190267 1042
It wasn't.

2098 6191393 3628
What was Mr. Moskovitz's ownership share
diluted down to?

2099 6195105 1334
It wasn't.

2100 6196523 2919
What was Sean Parker's ownership share
diluted down to?

2101 6199526 1042
It wasn't.

2102 6200652 2669
What was Peter Thiel's ownership share
diluted down to?

2103 6203405 1083
It wasn't.

2104 6204573 3002
And what was your ownership share
diluted down to?

2105 6208577 2668
.03%

2106 6219087 2293
- You signed the papers.
- You set me up.

2107 6221465 2543
You're gonna blame me because you were
the business head of the company,

2108 6224092 1876
and you made a bad business deal
with your own company?

2109 6226053 1625
It's gonna be like I'm not a part of Facebook.

2110 6227763 1333
It won't be like
you're not a part of Facebook.

2111 6229181 1042
You're not a part of Facebook.

2112 6230307 2376
- My name's on the masthead.
- You might wanna check again.

2113 6232768 1333
This because I froze the account?

2114 6234186 2168
You think we'd let you
parade around in your ridiculous suits,

2115 6236438 1042
pretending you were running this company?

2116 6237564 2335
Sorry, my Prada's at the cleaner's!

2117 6239983 4379
Along with my hoodie and my fuck-you
flip-flops, you pretentious douchebag!

2118 6244446 1667
Security's here. You'll be leaving now.

2119 6246198 2918
- I'm not signing those papers.
- We will get the signature.

2120 6249201 2126
Tell me this isn't about me
getting into the Phoenix.

2121 6253997 4212
You... You did it. I knew you did it.
You planted that story about the chicken!

2122 6258293 2126
- I didn't plant that story.
- What's he talking about?

2123 6260504 2960
- You had me accused of animal cruelty.
- Seriously. What the hell's the chicken?

2124 6263548 1710
And I'll bet what you hated the most

2125 6265342 3419
is that they identified me
as a co-founder of Facebook.

2126 6269221 2835
Which I am. You better lawyer up, asshole.

2127 6272140 4546
'Cause I'm not coming back for 30%.
I'm coming back for everything.

2128 6283151 2961
- Get him out of here.
- It's okay, I'm going.

2129 6288073 1292
Hang on.

2130 6291576 1584
Almost forgot.

2131 6294204 2293
Here's your $19,000.
I wouldn't cash it, though.

2132 6296581 1543
I drew it on the account you froze.

2133 6303422 2543
I like standing next to you, Sean.

2134 6307217 2126
It makes me look so tough.

2135 6322482 1292
Well...

2136 6324234 2919
That's it, that's our show for tonight, people.

2137 6327237 2293
And look, I wanna see everyone here
geared up for a party.

2138 6329614 2085
We're gonna walk into that club
like it's the Macy's Parade.

2139 6331783 3127
Mackey, put it up on the big screen.
We've gotta almost be there.

2140 6338165 1876
- You all right?
- Yeah.

2141 6341293 1459
You were kind of rough on him.

2142 6342836 2001
That's life in the NFL.

2143 6345047 1625
You know you didn't have to be
that rough on him.

2144 6346757 2167
- Listen, I put him...
- Sean!

2145 6350218 2085
You didn't have to be that rough on him.

2146 6352387 1209
He almost killed it.

2147 6356350 1208
I'll send flowers.

2148 6359269 4712
Speaking of flowers, I'm putting together
a party after the party at Kappa Eta Sigma.

2149 6364066 1250
Ashleigh's a sister.

2150 6365400 1542
- Ashleigh?
- The intern.

2151 6367027 3169
Yeah. I know who she is. Are you guys...

2152 6370822 1668
Ashleigh? Me? No.

2153 6372574 1459
Well, a little bit.

2154 6374910 1041
Why?

2155 6376036 1834
- No. Nothing, I just...
- Excuse me. Mark?

2156 6377954 3253
- We were just talking about you.
- Just that you're doing a really good job.

2157 6381875 2168
Thanks. I appreciate that.

2158 6385045 1083
These came in for you.

2159 6386213 1792
Put them on my desk.

2160 6394971 1418
What's the package?

2161 6397265 1042
Nothing.

2162 6400727 1501
- Mackey.
- Yes, sir.

2163 6402312 1292
Refresh.

2164 6404106 1208
Sweet!

2165 6411321 2043
And you're not a hugger.

2166 6413657 1292
I know.

2167 6417577 1459
One million!

2168 6420622 2752
Who's got champagne? Huh?

2169 6424709 1793
I've got champagne.

2170 6446356 3586
The next transformative development,
a picture-sharing application.

2171 6450026 3086
A place where you view pictures
that coincide with your social life.

2172 6453196 3002
It is the true digitalization of real life.

2173 6456283 2459
- You can use a CD.
- You can do it off of me.

2174 6458827 1709
You don't just go to a party anymore.

2175 6460620 3753
You go to a party with a digital camera,
and then your friends relive the party online.

2176 6464458 1375
And tagging. The idea...

2177 6465917 3211
- Would this be easier without the bra?
- It's worth finding out.

2178 6476887 2376
All right, shut the music down!

2179 6479639 1626
The party's over!

2180 6481349 1793
Everybody, go home!

2181 6483643 2460
I've spent hours watching
what people do when they log on.

2182 6486188 1375
How they check their friends' status updates.

2183 6487647 1501
Wait. That's weird. Why did the music stop?

2184 6489232 1167
Check to see which one of their friends

2185 6490484 1917
changed their profiles,
changed their photos...

2186 6492486 1583
Seriously, what happened to the music?

2187 6494154 1959
We lived on farms
and then we lived in cities,

2188 6496198 1959
and now we're going to live on the Internet!

2189 6498241 3670
Sean, stop.
I think something's going on downstairs.

2190 6510962 2794
Ladies and gentlemen,
can I have your attention, please?

2191 6513840 3252
It's time for you to go home.
The party is over.

2192 6517427 1834
Then it's all good.

2193 6521014 1083
- It's the cops.
- What?

2194 6522182 1042
Shit! Shit.

2195 6523308 3753
- Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.
- Okay, it's okay. Be cool.

2196 6527604 2168
Good to see you, Officer.
What can I do for you?

2197 6530982 1042
What's going on?

2198 6532108 2585
Was the music too loud?
We were having a celebration.

2199 6534778 1542
Miss, I need you to button your blouse.

2200 6536404 2794
I can tell them to turn the music down.

2201 6543119 1042
That's not mine.

2202 6544579 3002
Okay, we're gonna need identification.
Keep your hands where we can see them.

2203 6547666 1417
Oh, my God.

2204 6549167 1709
You got anything else in your pockets
I should know about?

2205 6550961 1041
No, sir. No.

2206 6552087 2251
- Don't be stupid, now.
- I don't, I don't.

2207 6559427 1501
What's this?

2208 6561137 1709
That's an EpiPen.

2209 6563932 2335
- And this?
- That's my inhaler.

2210 6567102 1667
How old are you?

2211 6569354 2919
Twenty-one.

2212 6572357 1417
- Twenty-one.
- I'm 21.

2213 6573858 1668
Lying only makes it worse.

2214 6576903 2502
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have lied.

2215 6590417 1041
Hello.

2216 6591543 2501
Listen, something's happened.

2217 6601344 1042
Shit.

2218 6602470 1918
No, it's all right. It's gonna be all right.

2219 6604472 4003
I posted bond, and I wasn't doing anything.
I mean, I've got allergies.

2220 6613273 1042
Interns.

2221 6614399 1834
It was just a party.

2222 6619029 3377
This is gonna be news, Sean.
It's gonna be online any second.

2223 6623617 1041
I know.

2224 6624743 1667
You know with an intern...

2225 6626494 2168
No, it's cool. I have it under control.

2226 6628747 1584
I will get it under control.

2227 6630457 2334
I will call someone
and see what the next move is.

2228 6632876 1542
But this is gonna be news now.

2229 6635170 2501
You don't think Wardo
was involved, do you?

2230 6637756 1041
I mean, do you think...

2231 6638882 1083
No.

2232 6640175 1876
Or Manningham. One of them.

2233 6642135 3252
Somebody. Somebody sent the coke
in there, because it got in there.

2234 6645472 1834
You believe me. God, this is gonna be fine.

2235 6652145 1209
Right?

2236 6656107 1584
Go home, Sean.

2237 6672916 1208
Mark?

2238 6676002 1084
Mark.

2239 6679589 1667
We're done for the day.

2240 6681341 2585
Yeah. Yeah, I was just sitting here.

2241 6687597 1918
What happened to Sean?

2242 6689849 2418
He still owns 7% of the company.

2243 6696439 4254
All you had all day was that salad.
Do you wanna get something to eat?

2244 6700777 1334
I can't.

2245 6709786 1250
I'm not a bad guy.

2246 6711121 1500
I know that.

2247 6712997 3503
When there's emotional testimony,
I assume 85% of it is exaggeration.

2248 6716626 1459
And the other 15?

2249 6718169 3127
Perjury. Creation myths need a devil.

2250 6724968 1333
What happens now?

2251 6727470 4212
Sy and the others are having a steak
on University Avenue.

2252 6732183 1459
Then they'll come back up to the office,

2253 6733727 3293
and start working on a settlement
agreement to present to you.

2254 6737147 1875
- They're gonna settle?
- Oh, yeah.

2255 6739649 2835
- And you're gonna have to pay a little extra.
- Why?

2256 6742569 2168
So that these guys sign
a nondisclosure agreement.

2257 6744821 3002
They say one unflattering word about you
in public, you own their wife and kids.

2258 6747907 1209
I invented Facebook.

2259 6749200 2126
I'm talking about a jury.

2260 6751578 2585
I specialize in voir dire, jury selection.

2261 6754247 2376
What a jury sees
when they look at a defendant.

2262 6756708 2376
Clothes, hair, speaking style, likeability...

2263 6759169 1208
Likeability.

2264 6760503 2835
I've been licensed to practice law
for all of 20 months,

2265 6763423 1375
and I could get a jury to believe

2266 6764883 2710
that you planted the story
about Eduardo and the chicken.

2267 6767677 1084
Watch what else.

2268 6769262 2084
Why weren't you at Sean's sorority party
that night?

2269 6772098 2210
- You think I'm the one that called the police?
- Doesn't matter.

2270 6774392 2085
I asked the question,
now everybody's thinking about it.

2271 6776561 2126
You've lost yourjury in the first 10 minutes.

2272 6780356 1126
Farm animals.

2273 6781566 1167
Yeah.

2274 6783735 2543
I was drunk and angry and stupid.

2275 6786362 2252
- And blogging.
- And blogging.

2276 6789741 1333
Pay them.

2277 6791367 1209
In the scheme of things,

2278 6793036 1333
it's a speeding ticket.

2279 6796372 2377
That's what Sy will tell you tomorrow.

2280 6798875 2877
Do you think anybody would mind if I stayed
and used the computer for a minute?

2281 6801878 1500
I can't imagine it would be a problem.

2282 6803463 1250
Thanks.

2283 6805548 2335
I appreciate your help today.

2284 6811721 2251
You're not an asshole, Mark.

2285 6815225 2501
You're just trying so hard to be.
