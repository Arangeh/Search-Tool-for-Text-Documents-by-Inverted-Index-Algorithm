548 1876080 1319
Just that my door is always open

549 1877400 1319
to you, Andie. But we gotta go.

550 1878720 1959
Come back here! Hey!

551 1880680 2601
And hold on to that thing, okay?

558 1941400 2559

I've been working on a bank heist
All the live long day

LUCKY:
Stop with the singing, will you?

563 1959880 3886
Can you believe this?
I can't believe this!

564 1965280 2123
Can you hear what
I'm saying to you?

565 1968880 1201

566 1970760 3639
FINGERS: And what's with that guy
cracking his knuckles all the time?

567 1974400 3409
You know that's gonna lead to a
serious arthritic condition.

568 1978240 3159
Thanks, chum. Sorry about that.
Went a little nuts.

569 1981400 2601
I didn't say
anything stupid, did I?

570 1984480 1201

571 1985800 2599

LUCKY: You kidding me?

573 1989560 2359

Is it a lot or is it a little?

574 1991920 1279
LUCKY: You're not serious, are you?

575 1993200 1239
Twenty of 100 is 20%.

576 1994440 3170
Ah, burying nuts for winter, huh?

577 1997920 1159
All right, listen up.

578 1999080 2199
We're gonna dig our own hole, a
tunnel from here to the alley,

579 2001280 2039
loot the whole place, get
fat for winter. Got it?

580 2003320 3319
20%. Twenty of 100, that's what
20% is. You didn't go to school?

581 2006640 1281
(GROWLS)
What's wrong with her?

582 2008200 3719
Probably complaining about the
substandard working conditions here.

All right, brainiac, let's move.

(PRECIOUS BARKING)

592 2036520 1559
Yes! Yes! Just give me that thing!

593 2038080 1880
There's food in there
for the park, isn't there?

594 2040120 1679
And you're gonna share it, right?

595 2041800 1119
- Never!
- Fine!

596 2042920 2282
All right! Share! I'll share!

597 2045280 1839
- Fifty-fifty.
- Fifty-fifty?

598 2047120 2159
I've never gone 50-50 in my life.

599 2049280 1639
Fifty-fifty! Fifty-fifty!

- Okay!

Thing-a-ma-booby.

604 2059360 1599
- Ugh!
- How do you like that, huh?

605 2060960 2839
- Okay, you win, you win!
Get that thing out of my face!
- Huh? Oh.

606 2063800 1199
You got me.

607 2065000 1279
So, you can talk.

608 2066280 2519
Okay, I'll stop talking, then.
Just don't blow that whistle.

609 2068800 1319
SURLY:
I'm not gonna feel sorry for you.

610 2070120 1879
- Of course, yes, I understand.
- Stay.

611 2072000 2319
All right, it's safe to come down.

612 2074320 2441
I'm gonna level with you, 'cause
you seem like a reasonable guy.

613 2076800 1519
If I don't get rid of you,

614 2078320 3759
they are gonna send me back
to the pound, all right?

615 2082080 2919
And I can't go back to that pound.

616 2085000 1759
SURLY: Oh, yeah, sure.
I believe you.

617 2086760 1559
No, I'm a victim of circumstance.

618 2088320 4199
Not my problem, dog. You guys okay?
Don't worry about her.

619 2092520 3159
This is incredible!

620 2095680 3204
There's enough food here
to feed the park for years!

621 2099520 2839
Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What're you doing?

622 2102360 1599
Look, can we be friends?

623 2103960 1719
- Oh, great.
- Come on!

624 2105680 1919
I can do all sorts of stuff.
You wanna see? You know what?

625 2107600 2599
I can fetch things. Huh?
I can sit.

626 2110200 2646
Look at this thing! This is crazy!

627 2112880 1159
Whoo, whoo, whoo.

628 2114040 1319
Has a mind of its own.

629 2115360 1079
Oh, Oh, Oh!

630 2116440 2439
I can play dead! Watch.
(GROANS)

631 2118880 1319
Now I'm alive.

632 2120200 2159
I mean, this is unbelievable.
It's like one to the next.

633 2122360 1725
Dead, then alive. Right?

634 2125200 1759
I'm getting some of this food
back to the park.

635 2126960 1399
- SURLY: What?
- We had a deal.

636 2128360 1319
Well, I can attack her,
if you want.

637 2129680 1039
I said, shut it.

638 2130720 3239
Look, the deal is, you take
your share, I get mine,

639 2133960 1199
we split ways.

640 2135160 2407
There's no way I can get
these to the park safely.

641 2138120 2441
We need a foolproof plan.

642 2140680 2919
Good luck with that. Buddy
and I are digging a tunnel.

643 2143600 2076
(LAUGHS)
That's just... That's crazy.

644 2145680 2601
No. It's brilliant!

645 2148880 2919
Oh, Raccoon and the animals will
flip when they hear about this!

646 2151800 2439
We'll be back, first thing tomorrow,
to get started on a tunnel.

647 2154240 1239
That's not part of the deal.

648 2155480 1239
Should I attack her now?

649 2156720 1839
What? No! You stay!

650 2158560 1804
I never said that
I'd work with the park.

651 2160520 2679
Well, you're welcome to come
back with me, if you want.

652 2163200 2479
Who knows, you might just
end up being a hero.

653 2165680 3204
I'll be back with the team.
Well done, Surly!

654 2169640 2851
Put a tail on her.
You know what I mean.

655 2172800 3363
Hey, boss, I'm gonna
lick your face.

656 2177080 2168
Come on, don't be weird.

657 2179920 4039
MOLE: I propose we assemble a team
and take the nuts for the park!

658 2183960 1199
ALL: Yeah!

659 2185160 1964
See? See, everybody?
What did I tell ya?

660 2187160 2519
The sunshiny days are here again.

661 2189680 3199
Okay. Okay, wait. Wait! But
we have to work with Surly.

662 2192880 3090
That's right! We are working with...
Are you nuts?

663 2196080 3761
I negotiated a deal with him.
We split everything, 50-50.

664 2199920 1199
Negotiate?

665 2201120 2079
With Surly? Are you kidding me?

666 2203200 2879
He's the reason we don't
have any nuts to begin with!

667 2206080 1719
ANDIE: No! No!
(ALL PROTESTING)

668 2207800 3359
Hey, listen. For as long as
this old mill has stood,

669 2211160 2919
we have always worked together
and kept our promises.

670 2214080 3249
We are not a pack of wild animals!

674 2224480 2959
If we don't work with Surly,
we won't survive.

675 2227440 3959
Did Grayson see this nut supply?

676 2231400 3039
No. Um... We got separated.

677 2234440 1531
Let's all wait until
Grayson gets back...

678 2236000 3039
We don't know
if Grayson's ever coming back.

gonna be handsome, then?

683 2246040 1799
RACCOON:
I have come to a decision.

684 2247840 4439
The Bruisers, Mole and Andie will
dig a tunnel to get the nuts out.

685 2252280 1440
Mole will lead.

686 2253800 1361
A-ha!

687 2255520 1319
I will?

688 2256840 3639
And while I don't trust Surly,
we will work with him. For now.

689 2260480 3919
When all the nuts are secure,
we will take what is ours.

690 2264400 2806
We do not honor deals with Surly.

691 2267640 1399
For the park!

692 2269040 1531
ALL: For the park! Yeah!

693 2283760 1850
Why aren't we doing this at night?

694 2288000 3719
All right, let's get to work!
Stand back!

695 2291720 4250
Guys, the nut store is over there.

696 2296400 1725
Allow me.

Hmm. Read my mind.

701 2310760 1759
Wait. We don't know what that...

wire from the tunnel.

718 2361800 1319
When you two hit the vault,

719 2363120 3039
we got three minutes to dynamite
it and get that dough out.

720 2366160 2919
We dig here, from the
alley into the basement.

721 2369080 1799
Why don't we just
use the door thing?

722 2370880 1559
Too unpredictable. They lock it

723 2372440 1599
from the inside.
Now, listen closely.

with bags of nuts.

We seal it,
we head for state lines.

It'll be days before the bank
realizes they got peanuts on deposit.

Agreed. But I do not dig.

Where are you?

are we talking, pops?

732 2392800 3599
We're talking almonds,
pistachios, walnuts, Brazils...

733 2396400 3359
Enough cashews
to buy yourselves a racetrack.

734 2399760 1964

the peanut brittle?

what is or isn't brick,

752 2439640 1399

this material has a high number
of brick-like properties.

Hey, what happened here?

808 2594000 2039
What happened?
I want some answers!

809 2596040 2646
Say, fellas. Look!

810 2599800 3679
That squirrel was trying
to blow up the nut store,

811 2603480 2039
and Precious stopped him!

812 2605520 3359
Can you believe it?
Good pup! Good pup!

813 2608880 1799
What's wrong with you?

814 2610680 1919
Get that wall cemented up.

815 2612600 2079
From now on,
I want that coal chute

816 2614680 2168
shut at all times, you hear me?

817 2619240 2089
Give the mutt a treat.

818 2621360 2168
Now cement that wall up!

819 2626240 2959
That dog is one smart dog.
She's smarter than you.

820 2629200 1119
She's smarter than you!

821 2630320 1159
She's smarter than me?

822 2631480 1079
No one's smarter than me.

823 2632560 2248
No one's smarter than you.

824 2637040 1079
That's right!

825 2638120 2639
Right! I'm glad we're
in agreement, for once.

Surly?

829 2658240 1599
Hey, what's going on?

830 2659840 1964
This trashcan has a hole in it.

831 2662240 5206
We use it as cover to dig a new
hole into the human hole. No brick.

832 2668360 2559
Now that's groundhog thinking,
right there.

833 2670920 1399
Okay, well, how long will it take?

834 2672320 3919
Day or two. Depending on any
pipes or rocks we come across.

835 2676240 1199
It'll be three days.

836 2677440 1199
It'll be two days!

837 2678640 1399
- Three!
- You wanna take this to the ground?

838 2680040 1719
Ridiculous! It'll never work!

839 2681760 1679
You'll need Raccoon's approval.

840 2683440 1199
You kiddin' me?

841 2684640 2851
Raccoon's gonna love this idea!

842 2687760 2279
Yeah. Raccoon. Guy's not even here

843 2690040 2362
and he's still ruining my life.

844 2697080 2239
I gotta tell ya,
the nerve of those bums!

845 2699320 1839
The nerve of those bums!

846 2701160 1759
"Raccoon would approve of this!"

847 2702920 4559
Oh, really? Raccoon! That guy,
he's a bigger thief than I am!

848 2707480 3159
But those blockheads can't see it.
They're blind as Mole.

I'm the brains of this outfit. I'm
the guy with the... The brains.

856 2763680 1159
What are you doing here?

Aren't you supposed to be working
on that tunnel? Raccoon's orders.

858 2768000 1839
There's something
you need to know.

859 2769840 1799
I haven't been completely honest.

860 2771640 1611
Yeah. Right.

861 2774040 2851
Raccoon's planning
to double-cross you.

We were all in on it. I'm
sorry, but just seeing how...

863 2780360 3283
Raccoon's always had it
out for me. And besides,

864 2784960 1884
who says I'm helping?

865 2786960 3443
But you are helping us,
aren't you?

866 2793080 2726
I'm helping myself.

867 2796400 2965
Right. My mistake.

868 2800880 3363
Just remember, Surly,
that park needs those nuts.

869 2804840 1884
Do what you will.

870 2821560 3519
I didn't authorize
any handouts, did I?

871 2825080 3249
You know Andie. it was her idea.

Are you looking for these?

874 2832080 4079

obedience. Can't follow orders.

875 2836160 1804
But she follows Surly.

876 2839360 2199
You know, he even tamed
that guard dog?

877 2841560 1690
He could actually pull this off.

It's only Surly,
a two-bit trash can thief.

887 2868520 1679
It's not about thievery.

888 2870200 3239
It's about that food
getting to those animals.

Never! You backstabbing vermin!

1335 4412880 2521
Surly goes down with me!

1336 4417360 3170
Buddy, that was some score.

1337 4420600 1919
We almost pulled it off,
didn't we?

1338 4422520 2248
Surly, don't you dare let go.

1339 4425240 1359
I'm sorry, Andie!

1340 4426600 1565
- What?
- No!

1346 4480560 2959
Thank you. Thank you.
No autographs, please.

1347 4483520 3409
You can admire the tail,
but no touching.

1369 4555120 1884

1381 4667920 2279
Okay, okay, okay,
enough, enough, enough.

1384 4675120 3319
Okay, Surly, so, see
you at the nut store.

1385 4678440 1999
Wait, what? That place?

1386 4680440 3479
Yeah, Lana's the new owner.
Hey, no more whistles, huh?

1387 4683920 1719
Just face licks.

1388 4685640 1645
Oh, hi, Andie.

1389 4688800 1361
Surly!

1390 4697480 2199
When you went over those falls,

1391 4699680 2328
I thought I'd never see you again.

1392 4702640 1839
Oh! We got to go. Come on.

1393 4704480 1519
Okay, calm down.
Where are we going?

1394 4706000 2959
You risked your life to save this park.
Everyone has to know.

1395 4708960 1361
No.

Okay, stop touching the tail.

1401 4725120 2399
I'm gonna keep
finding food for this park.

1402 4727520 3010
But from now on,
we do it together.

1403 4730840 1531
Deal?

1404 4733160 3363
This park will always
honor your deals, Surly.

1405 4751880 2319
SURLY: Yeah, they say life's
there for the taking,

1406 4754200 1326
but the truth is,

1407 4756520 3363
life's really there
for the sharing.

1408 4759960 1079
Huh.

1409 4761040 1959
Once you realize that,

1410 4763000 3399
you might discover there's a
little hero in all of us.
