278 1211945 1733
(CHUCKLES) Did you not?

279 1215981 1734
Yeah, that was a good fight.

280 1218717 1634
"A good fight."

281 1223655 1901
I think that's your problem
right there.

284 1246245 766
Congratulations.

285 1250582 1880
Watch your back with
that First Officer, though.

286 1254586 1167
Spock's not going
to be working with me.

287 1255755 1266
He's been transferred.

289 1262594 1701
You're going to be
my First Officer.

290 1265364 2001
Yeah, Marcus took
some convincing.

291 1269468 2301
But every now and then
I can make a good case.

292 1275507 1234
What did you tell him?

293 1277876 1701
The truth.

294 1279579 1332
That I believe in you.

295 1283515 2535
That if anybody deserves a
second chance, it's Jim Kirk.

SPOCK: Captain.

308 1337704 1666
Not anymore, Spock.
First Officer.

309 1341073 2735
I was demoted
and you were reassigned.

310 1343810 1299
It is fortunate
that the consequences

311 1345111 1566
were not more severe.

312 1346679 1266
(SIGHS) You've got to be
kidding me.

313 1347947 899
Captain, it was never
my intention...

314 1348848 1733
Not Captain.

315 1350583 1199
I saved your life, Spock.

316 1351784 1900
You wrote a report,
I lost my ship.

317 1355987 2802
Commander, I see now
I should have alerted you

318 1358791 1867
to the fact that
I submitted the report.

319 1360660 2133
KIRK: No, I'm familiar
with your compulsion

320 1362795 3068
to follow the rules. But
you see, I can't do that.

321 1365865 2000
Where I come from,
if someone saves your life,

322 1367867 1166
you don't stab him in the back.

323 1369035 2367
Vulcans cannot lie.

324 1371404 1266
Then I'm talking to the
half-human part of you.

325 1372672 2033
All right?

326 1374707 2668
Do you understand
why I went back for you?

327 1377377 3134
Commander Spock? Frank Abbot, U.S.S.
Bradbury.

328 1380513 1099
Guess you're with me.

329 1383615 1167
Yes, Captain.

330 1392657 1334
The truth is

331 1396094 1467
I'm going to miss you.

332 1404169 880
(SIGHS IN FRUSTRATION)

333 1406037 2001
ABBOT: Admiral Marcus, sir.

334 1409608 2902
Thank you for convening
on such short notice.

335 1412512 1099
Be seated.

336 1416481 2602
By now, some of you have heard
what happened in London.

337 1419085 2434
The target was
a Starfleet data archive.

338 1421521 1099
Now it's a damned
hole in the ground,

339 1422622 1833
42 men and women are dead.

340 1424457 1466
One hour ago,

341 1425925 1933
I received a message
from a Starfleet officer,

342 1427860 2301
who confessed to
carrying out this attack,

343 1430163 2533
that he was being
forced to do it by this man,

344 1432698 3202
Commander John Harrison.
He's one of our own.

345 1435902 2161
And he is the man responsible
for this act of savagery.

346 1439838 1367
For reasons unknown, John
Harrison has just declared

347 1441207 3401
a one-man war
against Starfleet.

348 1444610 3135
And under no circumstances
are we to allow this man

349 1447747 2801
to escape Federation space.

350 1450550 1366
You here tonight represent
the senior command

351 1451918 2033
of all the vessels
in the region.

352 1453953 2567
And in the name
of those we lost,

353 1456522 1667
you will run this bastard down.

354 1459658 3969
This is a manhunt, pure and
simple, so let's get to work.

355 1463629 1967
Earth's perimeter sensors
have not detected

356 1465598 1499
any warp signatures
leaving the system,

357 1467099 1081
so we know he can't be far.

358 1469835 2334
You will park your ships
in a blockade formation

359 1472171 2301
then deploy search vehicles
and landing parties

360 1474474 3401
to run down every lead.

361 1477877 1633
This man has shown willingness
to kill innocent people,

362 1479512 2567
so the rules of engagement
are simple.

363 1482081 2868
If you come across this man
and fear for your life

364 1484951 2133
or the lives of those nearby,

365 1487086 2934
you are authorized to
use deadly force on sight.

366 1490022 2067
What's in the bag?
James, not now.

367 1492091 1900
It doesn't seem odd to you
that he'd target an archive?

368 1493993 1733
It's like bombing a library.

369 1495728 2033
Chris?
Everything okay there?

370 1497763 2768
Yes, sir. Mr. Kirk
is just acclimating

371 1500533 1967
to his new position
as First Officer.

372 1502502 1399
You got something to say,
Kirk, say it.

373 1503903 1333
Tomorrow's too late.

374 1507772 1968
I'm fine, sir.
My apologies.

375 1509742 1533
Spit it out, son.
Don't be shy.

376 1512944 2802
Why the archive?

377 1515748 2400
All that information
is public record.

378 1518150 1561
If he really wanted
to damage Starfleet,

379 1522220 1701
this could just
be the beginning.

380 1523923 1900
The beginning of what,
Mr. Kirk?

381 1525825 2934
Sir, in the event of an
attack, protocol mandates

382 1528761 2801

He has asked
to see us right away.

the bastard got away.

figure out where he went?

427 1841907 2367
I already did, sir.
And you're no gonna like it.

he's not on Earth.

432 1855320 3569
(PANTING) He's on Kronos, sir.

433 1858891 1666
I request my command
be reinstated

434 1860559 1466
and your permission
to go after him.

Give us a minute.

Kronos.
Yes, sir.

437 1867967 2500
So Harrison's gone
to the Klingon homeworld.

438 1870469 1633
Is he defecting?
Uh, we're not sure, sir.

439 1872104 1399
He has taken refuge
in the Ketha Province,

440 1873505 1033
a region uninhabited
for decades.

441 1874540 1900
He's gotta be
hiding there, sir!

442 1876442 1199
He knows if we even
go near Klingon space,

443 1877643 1533
it'd be all-out war.

444 1879178 1833
Starfleet can't go after him,
but I can.

445 1882046 1167
Please, sir.

446 1886050 2468
All-out war with the Klingons
is inevitable, Mr. Kirk.

447 1888520 1667
If you ask me,
it's already begun.

448 1890189 1466
Since we first learned
of their existence,

449 1891657 2000
the Klingon Empire
has conquered and occupied

450 1893659 1600
two planets that we know of

451 1895261 1966
and fired on our ships
half a dozen times.

452 1899564 1400
They are coming our way.

453 1903067 2836
London was not an archive.

454 1905905 1366
It was a top-secret
branch of Starfleet

455 1907273 2934
designated Section 31.

456 1910209 1733
They were developing
defense technology

457 1911944 1967
and training our officers
to gather intelligence

458 1913913 1265
on the Klingons
and any other potential enemy

459 1915180 2401
who means to do us harm.

460 1917583 1733
Harrison was one
of our top agents.

461 1919318 2080
Well, now he's a fugitive
and I want to take him out.

462 1923488 2201
Pike always said you were
one of our best and brightest.

463 1926624 3503
You should have
heard him defend you.

464 1930129 2440
He's the one who talked you into
joining Starfleet, wasn't he?

465 1932931 2101
Yes, sir.

466 1935034 1920
Did he ever tell you
who talked him into joining?

is uninhabited?

my reinstatement.

498 2022420 1100
You're welcome.

499 2025123 2101
As I am again your First
Officer, it is now my duty

500 2027226 1760
to strongly object
to our mission parameters.

501 2029094 4569
There is no Starfleet regulation that
condemns a man to die without a trial,

502 2033665 2768
something you and Admiral
Marcus are forgetting.

503 2036435 2334
Also, preemptively
firing torpedoes

504 2038771 1699
at the Klingon homeworld
goes against...

505 2040472 1700
You yourself said
the area's uninhabited.

506 2042174 1361
There's only gonna be
one casualty.

507 2043742 3502
Our orders have nothing to do
with Starfleet regulation.

508 2047246 1566
Wait a minute. We're firing
torpedoes at the Klingons?

509 2048814 3535
Regulations aside, this
action is morally wrong.

510 2052351 2233
Regulations aside, pulling your ass
out of a volcano was morally right.

511 2054586 1133
And I didn't win
any points for that.

512 2055721 3335
I'm not gonna take
ethics lessons from a robot!

513 2059058 1332
Reverting to name-calling
suggests that you are defensive

514 2060392 1433
and therefore
find my opinion valid.

515 2061827 1666
I wasn't asking
for your opinion.

516 2063495 2301
Bones, get that thing
off my face.

517 2065798 2467
SPOCK: Captain, our mission could
start a war with the Klingons

518 2068267 2066
and it is, by its very
definition, immoral.

519 2070335 1834
Perhaps you should
take the requisite time

520 2072171 2166
to arrive at this
conclusion for yourself.

545 2145744 1833
Mr. Scott,
I understand your concerns,

546 2147579 2301
but we need these
torpedoes on board.

547 2149882 2500
Due respect, sir, but photon
torpedoes run on fuel.

548 2152384 1767
Now, I cannot detect
the type of fuel

549 2154153 1499
that's in the compartments
on these torpedoes

550 2155654 1533
because it's shielded.

551 2157189 2400
Now, I asked for the
specifications, but he said...

552 2159591 1934
It's classified.
It's classified.

553 2161527 1899
So I said,
"No specs, no signature!"

554 2163428 1834
SULU: Captain.

555 2165264 2100
Flight check's complete.
We're good to go, sir.

556 2167366 2066
Thank you, Mr. Sulu.
Yes, sir.

557 2169434 2281
Now if you'll excuse me, sir,
I have a warp core to prime.

558 2172436 1468
Get down!

559 2173906 1666
Jim, your vitals are way off.

560 2175574 2367
Report to the med bay.
Scotty!

561 2177943 1900
I need you to approve
those weapons.

562 2179845 2567
I don't have time
for a lecture, Scotty.

563 2182414 3034
Do you know what this is?
It's a warp core.

564 2185450 3068
It's a radioactive catastrophe
waiting to happen.

565 2188520 2100
A subtle shift
in magnetic output

566 2190622 2701
from, say, firing one or
more of six dozen torpedoes

567 2193325 1867
with an unknown payload

568 2195194 1232
could set off a chain
reaction which would kill

569 2196428 2200
every living thing
on this ship.

570 2198630 2200
Letting those torpedoes on board
the Enterprise is the last straw!

571 2200832 1934
What was the first straw?
What was the...

572 2202768 2033
There are plenty of straws.

573 2204803 2801
How about Starfleet confiscating
my transwarp equation?

574 2207606 2100
And now some madman's using
it to hop across the galaxy!

575 2209708 999
Where do you think
he got it from?

576 2210709 1566
We have our orders, Scotty!

577 2212277 2267
That's what scares me.

578 2214546 2401
This is clearly
a military operation.

579 2216949 1866
Is that what we are now?

580 2218817 1361
'Cause I thought
we were explorers.

581 2220651 2168

that's an order.

582 2224589 1700
Right, well,
you leave me no choice

583 2226291 1366
but to resign my duties.

584 2227659 2000
Oh, come on, Scotty.

585 2229661 1667
You're giving me no choice, sir.
I will not stand by...

586 2231330 1199
You're not giving me
much of a choice...

587 2232531 1132
Will you just make an
exception and sign...

588 2233665 1099
Do you accept
my resignation or not?

589 2234766 1667

going to tell me that?

in the weapons bay?

What are they?

980 3765362 1466
I don't know. That's
why I forged my transfer

981 3766830 1233
onto your ship to find out why.

982 3768065 2000
I do apologize for that.

any problems, I am sorry.

Torpedoes.

987 3777440 2435
My father gave me access
to every program he oversaw,

988 3779877 2467
then I heard he was developing
these prototype torpedoes.

989 3782346 1666
Uh-huh. When I went to
confront him about it,

990 3784014 2234
he wouldn't even see me.

991 3786250 1766
That's when I discovered the
torpedoes had disappeared

992 3788018 2467
from all official records.

993 3790487 2401
And then he gave them to me.

994 3792890 2467

reputation suggests, Captain Kirk.

995 3795359 2033

Of course it is.

Why?

1006 3815111 1233

1030 3869099 3034
Uh, no, sir. But I accept
full responsibility.

about being stuck

1036 3886450 1900

1037 3888352 1733
there was no torpedo!

1038 3890087 1299
KIRK: Dr. McCoy,
may I remind you,

1039 3891388 1633
you are not there to flirt.

1040 3893023 2120
So how can these legendary
hands help you, Dr. Marcus?

1041 3895291 1701
Bones!

1042 3896994 1432
CAROL: To understand how
powerful these weapons are,

1043 3898428 1567
we need to open the warhead.

1044 3899997 1432
To do that, we need to
access the fuel compartment.

1045 3901431 1467
Unfortunately for us,

1046 3902900 2300
the warheads on these
weapons are live.

bundle of fiber optic cables

1053 3918115 1266
against the inner casing.

1054 3919383 2066
You'll need to cut
the 23rd wire down.

1055 3921451 1567
Whatever you do,
do not touch anything else.

1056 3923020 1299
Do you understand?

1057 3924321 1900
Right. The thought
never crossed my mind.

1058 3926223 1166
CAROL: Dr. McCoy,

1059 3927391 2634
wait for my word.

1060 3930027 1566
I'm rerouting
the detonation process.

1061 3931595 2067
Are you ready?
And raring.

1062 3933664 2267
Good luck.

Sir, the torpedo
just armed itself.

detonate in 30 seconds, sir!

1091 4088085 3267
This fuel container's been
removed from the torpedo

and retrofitted
to hide this cryo tube.

1093 4095724 1200

1094 4098194 1967
But if we try to revive him

1095 4100163 2067

it could kill him.

This technology's beyond me.

1097 4104234 1867
How advanced, Doctor?

1098 4106103 3368
It's not advanced.
That cryo tube is ancient.

1099 4109473 3368
We haven't needed to freeze anyone
since we developed warp capability,

1100 4112843 2533
which explains the most interesting
thing about our friend here.

1101 4116178 1134
He's 300 years old.

1102 4126589 1361

There are men and women

in all those torpedoes,

1105 4132496 1232
I put them there.

1106 4137433 840
Who the hell are you?

1107 4142605 2301
A remnant of a time long past.

1108 4146609 2101
Genetically engineered
to be superior

1109 4148712 2534
so as to lead others
to peace in a world at war.

1110 4152882 4503
But we were condemned as
criminals, forced into exile.

1111 4158787 1668
For centuries we slept,

1112 4162158 4069
hoping when we awoke,
things would be different.

1113 4166229 2234
But as a result
of the destruction of Vulcan,

1114 4168465 2067
your Starfleet began
to aggressively search

1115 4170534 1699
distant quadrants of space.

1116 4172235 2567
My ship was found adrift.
I alone was revived.

1117 4174804 1867
KIRK: I looked up
"John Harrison."

1118 4176673 1533
Until a year ago,
he didn't exist.

1119 4178208 2067
John Harrison was a fiction

1120 4180277 1666
created the moment I was awoken

1121 4181945 3468
by your Admiral Marcus
to help him advance his cause.

1122 4185415 2968
A smokescreen
to conceal my true identity.

1123 4189618 2101
My name is,

1124 4191721 1500
Khan.

1125 4198394 3135
Why would a Starfleet Admiral

1126 4201531 3669
ask a 300-year-old
frozen man for help?

1127 4205202 2700
Because I am better.

1128 4207904 2301
At what?
Everything.

1129 4211840 2369
Alexander Marcus
needed to respond to

1130 4214211 2066
an uncivilized threat
in a civilized time

1131 4216279 2134
and for that
he needed a warrior's mind.

1132 4218415 1866
My mind.

1133 4220283 2200
To design weapons and warships.

1134 4222485 2101
SPOCK: You are suggesting
the Admiral

1135 4224588 2033
violated every regulation
he vowed to uphold

1136 4226623 2167
simply because he wanted
to exploit your intellect.

1137 4228792 2634
He wanted to exploit
my savagery.

1138 4231428 2801
Intellect alone is useless
in a fight, Mr. Spock.

1139 4234231 1566
You... You can't
even break a rule.

1140 4235799 2200
How would you be
expected to break bone?

1141 4239468 3169
Marcus used me
to design weapons.

1142 4242639 2767
To help him realize his vision
of a militarized Starfleet.

1143 4245408 3068
He sent you
to use those weapons.

1144 4248478 3401
To fire my torpedoes
on an unsuspecting planet.

1145 4252982 3302
And then he purposely
crippled your ship

1146 4256286 3568
in enemy space, leading to
one inevitable outcome.

1147 4259856 1600
The Klingons
would come searching

1148 4261458 2033
for whomever was responsible,

1149 4263493 2300
and you would have
no chance of escape.

1150 4265795 4169
Marcus would finally
have the war he talked about.

1151 4269966 1667
The war he always wanted.

1152 4271967 1668
No. No.

1153 4275437 3436
I watched you open fire in a room
full of unarmed Starfleet officers.

1154 4278875 1933
You killed them in cold blood!

1155 4280810 2634
Marcus took my crew from me.

1156 4283446 2301
You are a murderer!

1157 4285749 2233
He used my friends
to control me.

1158 4292655 2835
I tried to smuggle them
to safety

1159 4295492 1432
by concealing them
in the very weapons

1160 4296926 1667
I had designed,

1161 4300596 1801
but I was discovered.

1162 4304066 3336
I had no choice
but to escape alone.

1163 4309438 4103
And when I did, I had
every reason to suspect

1164 4313543 4302
that Marcus had killed
every single one

1165 4317847 3001
of the people I hold most dear.

1166 4325321 2234
So I responded in kind.

1167 4331660 1167
My crew

1168 4333462 3269
is my family, Kirk.

I wasn't expecting you.

1191 4413609 1967
That's a hell of a ship
you got there.

1192 4415578 4069
That you'd taken Harrison into
custody in violation of your orders.

1193 4420783 2067
Well, we, uh...

1194 4422852 1867
We had to improvise
when our warp core

1195 4424721 2167
unexpectedly malfunctioned.

1196 4426890 2066
But you already knew that,
didn't you, sir?

1197 4428958 1633
MARCUS: I don't
take your meaning.

1198 4430593 1366
Well, that's why
you're here, isn't it?

1199 4431961 1834
To assist with our repairs?

1200 4434897 1867
Why else would
the head of Starfleet

1201 4436766 1880
personally come to the edge
of the Neutral Zone?

1202 4440068 1735
Captain,
they're scanning our ship.

1203 4441805 1720
Is there something
I can help you find, sir?

1204 4444807 1700
Where is your prisoner, Ki?

1205 4446509 1433
KIRK: Per Starfleet
regulation,

1206 4447944 3702
I'm planning on returning Khan
to Earth to stand trial.

1207 4452815 1400
Well, shit.

1208 4455551 1267
You talked to him.

1209 4458687 2869
This is exactly what I was
hoping to spare you from.

1210 4461558 2500
I took a tactical risk
and I woke that bastard,

1211 4464060 2534
believing that
his superior intelligence

1212 4466596 1132
could help us protect ourselves

1213 4467730 1200
from whatever came at us next.

1214 4470999 2502
But I made a mistake.

1215 4473503 2701
And now the blood of everybody
he's killed is on my hands.

1216 4476972 1734
So I'm asking you,

1217 4479141 2068
give him to me

1218 4481211 2400
so that I can end
what I started.

1219 4487516 1534
And what exactly
would you like me to do

1220 4489052 1633
with the rest of his crew, sir?

1221 4492654 3436
Fire them at the Klingons?
End 72 lives?

1222 4496092 1933
Start a war in the process?

1223 4498027 2935
He put those people
in those torpedoes.

1224 4500964 1733
And I simply
didn't want to burden u

1225 4502699 2200
with knowing
what was inside of the.

1226 4504901 1967
You saw what this man
can do all by himself.

1227 4506870 2367
If we woke up
the rest of his crew?

1228 4511540 2401
What else did he tell you?
That he's a peacekeeper?

1229 4513943 3302
He's playing you, so,
don't you see that?

1230 4517247 3735
Khan and his crew were condemned
to death as war criminals.

1231 4520984 2133
And now it is our duty
to carry out that sentence

1232 4523119 1867
before anybody else
dies because of hi.

Can you hear me? Scotty!

1328 4840302 2134
Guess what I found
behind Jupiter.

1329 4842438 2033
You're on that ship!
I snuck on.

1330 4844473 1633
And seeing as I've just
committed an act of treason

1331 4846108 1734
against a Starfleet Admiral,
I'd really like

1332 4847844 2000
to get off this bloody ship.
Now beam me out!

1341 4865862 1432
Our options are limited,

1342 4867296 1600
We cannot fire
and we cannot flee.

1343 4872234 1634
There is one option.

1344 4873870 1599
Uhura,
when you get Scotty back,

1345 4875471 1967
patch him through.
Yes, sir.

1346 4877440 1121
Mr. Spock,
you have the conn.

1347 4882878 2101
Captain, I strongly object.

1348 4884981 1966
To what? I haven't
said anything yet.

1349 4886949 1533
Since we cannot take
the ship from the outside,

1350 4888484 1733
the only way we can take it
is from within.

1351 4890219 1400
And as a large boarding party
would be detected,

1352 4891621 1366
it is optimal for you to take

1353 4892989 1966
as few members
of the crew as possible.

1354 4894957 2301
You will meet resistance,
requiring personnel

1355 4897260 1132
with advanced combat abilities

1356 4898394 2234
and innate knowledge
of that ship.

1357 4900630 2000
This indicates that
you plan to align with Khan,

1358 4902632 2400
the very man
we were sent here to destroy.

something I firmly believe

you are incapable
of doing in this moment.

1370 4924921 1165
You're right!

1371 4928023 1600
What I'm about to do,
it doesn't make any sense,

1372 4929625 2034
it's not logical.
It is a gut feeling.

1373 4935563 2102
I have no idea
what I'm supposed to do.

1374 4939200 3436
I only know what I can do.

not a torpedo technician!

1583 5632394 1433
The fact that you
are a doctor is precisely

1584 5633829 1561

to listen very carefully.

I will kill your Captain

you will also destroy
your own people.

to survive, mine does not.

I'm scared, Spock.

1840 6579139 1634
Help me not be.

1841 6585679 1934
How do you choose not to feel?

1842 6594321 1600
I do not know.

1843 6598959 1800
Right now I am failing.

1844 6608034 2635
I want you to know
why I couldn't let you die.

1845 6614908 1434
Why I went back for you.

1846 6618612 2067
Because you are my friend.

Can we beam him up?

CHEKOV: There's too much damage.

1869 6834395 1833
I have no incoming signal.

But it may be possible
to beam you down, sir.

1871 6839199 933
Go get him.

1872 6845972 2401
Stand by for coordinates.
Yes, sir.

1873 6848375 2835
Enter 3517 by 2598.

I think he can save Kirk.

1898 7097624 1633
Can we beam them up

1908 7164525 3801
PIKE: Your father was captain
of a starship for 12 minutes.

1909 7168328 3302
He saved 800 lives.
I dare you to do better.

1910 7171931 1367
(GASPS)

1911 7181440 3036
Oh, don't be so melodramatic.
You were barely dead.

1912 7184478 2434
It was the transfusion
that really took its toll.

1913 7186914 865
You were out cold
for two weeks.

1914 7187781 1700
Transfusion?

1915 7189483 2100
Your cells were heavily irradiated.
We had no choice.

1916 7192451 1367
Khan?

1917 7193820 1667
Once we caught him,

1918 7195489 2734
I synthesized a serum
from his superblood.

1919 7198225 2334
Tell me, are you feeling,
uh, homicidal?

1920 7200561 1766
Power mad? Despotic?

1921 7202329 1399
No more than usual.

1922 7204463 934
How'd you catch him?

1923 7205831 1368
I didn't.

1924 7216209 2301
You saved my life.

1925 7218512 2161
Uhura and I had something to
do with it, too, you know.

1926 7222582 2134
You saved my life, Captain.
And the lives...

1927 7224718 1166
Spock, just...

1928 7227653 1200
Thank you.

1929 7230489 1968
You are welcome, Jim.

1930 7243869 2769
KIRK: There will always be
those who mean to do us ha.

1931 7248708 2701
To stop them,

1932 7251411 3101
we risk awakening the same
evil within ourselves.

1933 7260987 2735
Our first instinct
is to seek revenge

1934 7263724 1799
when those we love
are taken from us.

1935 7268861 1534
But that's not who we are.

1936 7272031 2001
We are here today

1937 7274034 3268
to rechristen
the U.S.S. Enterprise,

1938 7277304 2267
and to honor those
who lost their lives

1939 7280673 2602
nearly one year ago.

1940 7283277 2200
When Christopher Pike
first gave me his ship

1941 7285479 1866
he had me recite
the Captain's Oath,

1942 7288648 2301
words I didn't appreciate
at the time.

1943 7292285 2434
Now I see them as a call
for us to remember

1944 7295755 1700
who we once were,

1945 7299558 2135
and who we must be again.

1946 7303029 1467
And those words?

1947 7305498 3903
Space, the final frontier.

1948 7309403 3034
These are the voyages
of the starship Enterprise.

1949 7313506 1967
Her five-year mission,

1950 7315475 2868
to explore strange new worlds,

1951 7318345 4135
to seek out new life
and new civilizations,

1952 7322482 3168
to boldly go
where no one has gone before.

1953 7328888 1700
CHEKOV: Captain on the bridge.

1954 7334093 2368
It's hard to get out of it
once you've had a taste,

1955 7336463 1499
isn't that right, Mr. Sulu?

1956 7337964 2401
"Captain" does have
a nice ring to it.

1957 7340367 1166
Chair's all yours, sir.

1958 7343502 1601
Mr. Scott.

1959 7345105 1333
How's our core?

1960 7346440 1900
Purring like a kitten, Captain.

1961 7348342 1532
She's ready for a long journey.

1962 7350376 1434
Excellent.

1963 7351812 2100
Come on, Bones!
It's gonna be fun.

1964 7355614 3169
Five years in space.
God help me.

1965 7358785 1266
Dr. Marcus.

1966 7361954 1920
Uh... I'm glad you could be
a part of the family.

1967 7364056 1367
It's nice to have a family.

1968 7368027 866
KIRK: Spock.

1969 7369395 1100
Captain.

1970 7373566 1267
Where shall we go?

1971 7376802 2635
As a mission of this duration
has never been attempted,

1972 7381807 2035
I defer to your
good judgment, Captain.

1973 7393018 2435
Mr. Sulu, take us out.

1974 7395855 1066
Aye, Captain.
