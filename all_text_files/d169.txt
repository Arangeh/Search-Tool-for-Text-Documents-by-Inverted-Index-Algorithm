Come on, you can't be this stupid.

286 688229 1477
This is a misunderstanding.

287 689856 1898
I'm just a regular,
normal, ordinary guy.

288 691900 2194
I'm late to meet my best
friends in the whole world.

289 694235 896
They're probably
missing me right now.

290 695278 1568
They're probably out
looking around.

291 696988 2301
"Hey, where's Emmet? Hey,
where's my best friend Emmet?"

292 699365 2353
Hey, you know what? Ask all
my friends. They'll tell you.

293 702327 2319
Oh, we asked them, all right.

294 704787 942
Boom!

295 705872 2194
That guy's not a
criminal mastermind.

296 708208 896
See?

297 709250 3525
Yeah. You know, he's kind of an
average, normal kind of guy.

298 712921 1022
Thank you.

JIM: But, you know, he's not, like...

300 715048 2273
normal like us. No.

301 717467 2819
He's not that special.

302 720428 2853
GAIL ON TV: Wait, I'm so confused.
Who are we talking about?

303 725099 1397
Wait, does he work with us?

304 726643 1443
Gail doesn't remember me?

305 728228 976
BARRY ON TV: Look at Randy here.

306 729354 2603
He likes sausage. That's something.

307 732106 2649
Gail is perky. That's something.

308 734901 646
And Harry...

309 735693 2273
- well...
- When you say Harry, I go:

310 738112 1647
(LAUGHS)

311 739906 2694
When you say the other guy, I go:

312 743660 1101
BARRY: Harry's the best!

313 744911 2228
-  Harry's got personality.
- WORKER ON TV: He's weird! He's weird!

314 747288 3274
I know that guy but I know,
like, zippy-zap about him.

315 750708 1568
We just talked earlier.

316 752418 1898
I mean, all he does is say yes...

317 754462 2148
to everything everybody
else is doing.

318 756756 2228
You know, he's just
sort of a "Hmm!"

319 759133 2819
Little bit of a blank
slate, I guess.

320 762512 2478
That'll be $42, please.

321 765139 4071
We all have something that makes
us something and Emmet is...

nothing.

Don't be so serious.

- BUSINESS: Hey, buddy!

562 1369910 1852
- I missed you.
- Aw, did you really?

563 1371912 1751
Have I ever shown you
my relic collection?

564 1373664 1272
Nope. I don't think you have.

Nobody knows where
this stuff comes from.

566 1376917 976
This one...

is the Cloak of Ban Da'ld.

painful to take off.

569 1381338 1647

No, but thank you.

573 1389722 1727
and torturing them and whatnot.

Thank you, sir.

can ruin my plans.

578 1397313 2420
(CHUCKLING) The one thing that
I asked you to take care of.

579 1400274 1693
That's super frustrating.

580 1402109 2819
It makes me just wanna
pick up whoever...

581 1405070 1898
is standing closest to me...

582 1407114 1818
and throw them through
this window...

I wanna do it so bad.

585 1417917 2148
I know you do, sir. Please don't.

586 1420210 3400
And it's not just you, Bad Cop,
that keeps messing up my plans.

587 1423756 3730
People everywhere are always
messing with my stuff.

588 1427885 2694
But I have a way to fix that.

589 1430763 3479
A way to keep things exactly the
way they are supposed to be.

- Sir, I don't know if this is necessary.

605 1472054 2319
Oh, don't worry.
I won't test it on you.

606 1474515 1602
I'll do it on your parents!

Okay, Pa. I just want
you to act naturally.

- Gotcha.

613 1489238 1568
Yeah. Keep your hand up like that.

624 1505754 2444
- Pa, you just moved and you've just wrecked it!
- Uh-huh.

625 1508340 771
You wrecked it!

626 1509258 2273

I'm talking about?

637 1539038 2102
- Does that upset you, Bad Cop?
- Um...

638 1541290 3354
Surely you feel bad for your parents,
and you wanna help them, don't you?

639 1544793 3900
We're okay, son.
Just a little stuck, is all.

640 1548839 1693
Go ahead...

641 1552092 1693
finish the job.

642 1553927 1397
Of course, sir.

643 1555471 1192
No, I don't want to.

644 1556805 1602

you are The Special.

719 1738987 2569

- I'm not sure he's The Special.

720 1741698 1602

732 1770227 2819
See? He can't do it. He will
never be a MasterBuilder.

733 1773188 2398
Of course not. Not if you
keep telling him he can't.

734 1775732 1602
He needs to see that he can.

I'm not hearing a lot
of activity here.

744 1800007 2603
I don't think he's ever had an
original thought. In his life.

745 1802759 1067
Ha, ha. That's not true.

746 1803969 1943
For instance, one time
I wanted to have...

747 1806054 2068
a bunch of my friends
over to watch TV...

748 1808265 3525
Not unlike this TV that
just showed up magically.

749 1811935 1943
And not everybody can
fit on my one couch...

750 1814021 1181
and I thought to myself:

751 1815314 1980
"What if there was such a
thing as a bunk bed...

752 1817316 1226
but as a couch?"

753 1818692 2398
Introducing the
double-decker couch.

754 1821236 2944
So everyone could watch TV
together and be buddies!

755 1824948 2140
That is literally the dumbest
thing I've ever heard.

756 1827200 2444
Please, Wyldstyle,
let me handle this.

757 1829786 2944
That idea is just the worst.

758 1832873 1818
There must be something
around here...

759 1834833 1272
that proves his potential.

760 1836251 2523
If The Man Upstairs chose
him to be The Special...

761 1838920 1226
there must be a reason.

762 1840297 1500
- EMMET: Who's The Man Upstairs?
- See?

763 1841798 1751
He doesn't even know
about The Man Upstairs.

764 1843550 1477
EMMET: Does he have, like,
super-gross hands...

765 1845177 2209
that look like they're made
out of big pink sausages?

766 1847387 2102
Like eagle talons mixed with squid?

767 1849639 2649
Wait. You've seen the...?

768 1853060 692
EMMET: Whoa!

769 1853894 1943
That's what I was
just thinking about.

770 1855979 771
How did you...?

771 1856897 1226
I had this weird dream
when I touched the Piece.

772 1858273 2102
Well, I mean, I wasn't asleep,
so it wasn't really a dream.

773 1860525 2148
Emmet, you had a vision.

774 1862819 896
I did?

775 1863862 1568
MasterBuilders spend years...

776 1865572 2043
training themselves to clear
their minds enough...

777 1867616 3354
to have even a fleeting glimpse
of The Man Upstairs...

778 1871119 3775
and yet, your mind is already
so prodigiously empty...

779 1875040 3104
that there is nothing in it to
clear away in the first place.

780 1878293 1192
With proper training...

781 1879669 2478
you could become a
great MasterBuilder.

782 1882297 1022
I could?

783 1883465 2353

I'm supposed to do.

787 1894059 726

788 1895519 2194
you will see everything.

1094 2653151 3070
This is supposed to
make us feel better?

1095 2656362 2273
No, there was about to be a "but."

1096 2658781 1943
- You're a butt!
- Yes.

MAN 1: You're not even a bit special.

1107 2684265 2649
Well, you were right about
him being a ding-dong.

1108 2687059 1693
MAN 2: You're a huge disappointment.

1109 2689395 2819
MAN 3: Get him out of here.
I don't wanna look at him.

1110 2695693 2319

can't get any worse.

1127 2739904 1977

- It's game time.

1128 2744951 1818
Y'all ready for this?

1129 2748621 1852
Oh, no! They were ready for that.

1130 2750623 740

really wanna build...

we can't be found?

Thank you, Batman.
Your ideas are the best.

1166 2823154 940
But I just said that.

1167 2824113 3070
- We could build a submarine.
- A Bat-Submarine, patent pending.

With rainbows!

1169 2828326 1977
And dream catchers, in
case we take a nap.

all of them at once.

you don't have him?

was a double-decker couch.

and you're watching TV...

are you gonna have to watch
through a bunch of dangling legs?

sit on the bottom?

I don't mean to spoil the party,
but does anyone else notice...

1282 3164787 2319
we're stuck in the middle
of the ocean on this couch?

forces completely overlook it.

talented and imaginative.

1314 3254501 3104
But you can't work
together as a team.

1316 3260883 3070
But when I had a plan and we
were all working together...

1317 3264094 2649

build a skyscraper.

happen if you did that.

1324 3286700 1101

1326 3293499 2102
some construction paper...

1327 3297711 2728
and some glitter glue!

inside the Tower..."

like them back in the city.

1333 3312768 2603

the air ducts and wiring are located.

1334 3315521 1022

1335 3316688 1317

in a Bat-Spaceship, or a pirate spaceship
or a rainbow-sparkle spaceship.

1342 3332329 2774
that's exactly like all the other
Octan delivery spaceships.

1343 3335249 3274
So not the special spaceship that I'm
building for all of you right now?

1344 3338669 1477
Sorry, Benny. Maybe next time.

1345 3340295 2979
Ooh, you're really letting the
oxygen out of my tank here.

1346 3344550 2140
Yeah, but according to your
precious instructions...

1347 3346718 1602
this ship needs a hyperdrive.

1348 3348470 1060
We don't have that part.
